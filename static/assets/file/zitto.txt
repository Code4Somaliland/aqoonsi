I am so moved by Somaliland, the people. Unrecognized but so proud of their motherland. They donâ€™t care what the world think, they do better election than Tanzania. Than Uganda. Than Nigeria. So poor but brave to face their challenges. The future is here. LET US MAKE SOMALILAND THE 55th AU member.
