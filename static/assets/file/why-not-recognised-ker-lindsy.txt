Around the world, there are many territories vying for indepen dence and international recognition.
0:05
Of these, few would appear to have a stronger claim to international acceptance as Somaliland,
0:11
which seceded from Somalia in 1991.
0:14
By all accounts, it meets all the main criteria for statehood.
0:18
It also enjoys considerable international sympathy.
0:21
And yet, after three decades, it remains completely unrecognised.
0:26
In this video, I'm going to take a look at why it has faced such an uphill battle
0:30
to gain formal international acceptance and consider whether this could change.

Hello. My name is James Ker-Lindsay.
0:48
Welcome to 'Independent Thinking'.

A channel dedicated to international relations, statehood, independence and the origins of countries.
0:56
Somaliland has emerged as one of the most interesting cases of secession in modern international politics.
1:03
Lying in the Horn of Africa, on the coast of the Gulf of Aden,
1:06
it has effectively existed as a fully independent entity for the past 30 years.
1:11
And yet, while it maintains strong relations with a number of countries,
1:15
all its efforts to persuade the international community to recognise it have failed.
1:21
So, why has it faced such a struggle to be accepted?
History
1:25
The territory first emerged in the late 19th century, when the area fell under British colonial rule
1:31
- becoming the British Somaliland Protectorate, in 1884.
1:35
This set it apart from neighbouring Italian Somaliland, to the east and the south.
1:40
As Britain retreated from its empire, the decision was made to grant the territory independence.
1:45
And, on 26 June 1960, the State of Somaliland came into existence.
1:51
It was immediately recognised by over 30 countries, including the United Kingdom.
1:57
However, the new country was short-lived.
2:00
Just days later, on 1 July 1960, the Italian administered Trust Territory of Somaliland became independent
2:07
and the two countries officially merged to form the Somali Republic.
2:12
Despite the initial jubilation at unification, it quickly became an unhappy relationship.
2:17
In 1961, a new constitution was passed - despite having been opposed by Somaliland voters -
2:23
that effectively downgraded Somaliland by making it an autonomous province of the Republic.
2:29
In the years that followed, this resentment grew as Somaliland became increasingly marginalised
2:34
by the Somali central government, in Mogadishu.
2:37
This sense of alienation increased after Somalia fell under the dictatorial rule of General Siad Barre,
2:44
following a coup, in 1969.
2:46
In the late 1980s, the central government viciously put down an uprising in Somaliland,
2:51
resulting the deaths of many tens of thousands and the heavy bombing of the province's capital, Hargeisa.
2:57
In January 1991, Barre finally was overthrown by clan forces from across the country, including Somaliland.
3:05
However, rather than usher in a new period of stability, it instead led to a civil war in the south of the country.
3:11
As the rest of Somalia descended into conflict and anarchy following the collapse
3:16
of the central government in Mogadishu, Somaliland seized its opportunity to break away.
3:22
On 18 May 1991, it unilaterally declared independence
3:27
- or, as the leaders in Somaliland would say, it reclaimed its independence.
Statehood
3:32
In the three decades since it seceded from Somalia, Somaliland has managed to consolidate its position.
3:39
So-much-so that it is now widely accepted that it meets the criteria for statehood
3:44
laid down by the Montevideo Convention.
3:46
For a start, it has a defined territory.
3:49
However, it's worth pointing out that the situation is complicated by an ongoing boundary dispute
3:55
with neighbouring Puntland - an autonomous province of Somalia to its east.
4:01
On top of this, a secessionist movement has emerged in eastern Somaliland that seeks to break away
4:07
and unite with Somalia - albeit as a separate entity from Puntland
4:12
Notwithstanding this rather confusing situation,
4:14
Somaliland nevertheless meets the territorial requirements for statehood.
4:19
Secondly, it also clearly has a settled population.
4:23
According to most recent estimates, the current population of Somaliland is in the region
4:27
of three and a half to four million people.
4:30
Thirdly, it has a government.
4:32
Indeed, this is one of its key selling points.
4:35
In stark contrast to the political chaos that has existed in Somalia for much of the past thirty years,
4:41
Somaliland has long been a bastion of calm and stability.
4:45
Crucially, it's government is also fully independent.
4:49
There's no suspicion that it's merely a proxy for another power.
4:53
On the fourth criteria, the ability to enter into relations with other states, the situation is especially interesting.
5:00
Somaliland enjoys greater international acceptance than many other wholly unrecognised states.
5:05
As well as enjoying good relations with its neighbours,
5:08
it has established representative offices in the United States,
5:12
as well as a number of European and African countries
5:15
- although it has to be stressed that these actually have no formal diplomatic status.
5:20
Interestingly, it has particularly close ties to Britain.
5:24
As well as providing aid to Somaliland, British officials often meet with Somaliland leaders
5:29
- both in London and in Hargeisa.
5:31
Perhaps the most significance of these meetings came in January 2019, when Gavin Williamson,
5:37
the then British Defence Secretary, paid an official visit to Somaliland and met with the President,
5:42
the Foreign and Defence Ministers, as well as senior members of the Somaliland Armed Forces.
5:48
However, balanced against this, London continues to insist that it does in fact recognise
5:53
the territorial integrity of Somalia.
5:56
On top of all this, Somaliland also maintains many of the other trappings of statehood,
6:01
including its own flag, its own currency and, of course, its own Armed Forces.
6:06
It even enjoys direct flights to neighbouring countries, such as Ethiopia, Kenya and even Dubai
6:12
- making actually relatively accessible.
Why
6:15
So, why hasn't it been recognised?
6:17
In truth, and somewhat paradoxically, it's actually both easy and hard to explain.
6:23
One thing that's worth highlighting from the start is that its previous independence actually
6:28
tends to have little bearing on the discussion in any formal sense.
6:32
Under international law, a territory that voluntarily gives up its independence to join another country,
6:38
doesn't in fact have a right to reclaim its statehood at will.
6:42
I'll take a look at this important point
6:44
- which has impact on all sorts of other disputes, including Scotland and even Texas - in a future video.
6:51
In the meantime, to this end, even though it has become an important moral argument that is heavily pressed by
6:56
Somaliland leaders, its previous independence doesn't in fact carry as much weight as many would want.
7:04
That said, in other ways, the traditional rules concerning secession don't quite seem to apply to Somaliland
7:10
in the same way that they do elsewhere.
7:13
Somaliland hasn't really faced the opprobrium usually reserved the unilateral secession
7:18
in international politics.
7:20
Maybe this is because it was once an independent country, and isn't actually a case
7:24
of invasion and occupation by an external actor - as is the case in many other instances.
7:30
Indeed, it's long been tacitly understood that, for a variety of reasons,
7:35
it does seem to amount to a rather special case.
7:39
This was made clear when, in 2005, the African Union sent a fact-finding mission to Somaliland.
7:46
In its final report, the mission recommended recognition.
7:49
Highlighting steps that the country had taken towards becoming a "modern state",
7:54
it noted that Somaliland's situation was "unique and self-justified in African political history",
8:01
therefore the case "should not be linked to the notion of opening a Pandora's box".
8:07
This was highly significant as it seemed to offer Somaliland a path
8:12
to eventual full international recognition - at least at the time.
8:17
The view emerged that if the African Union was willing to accept Somaliland's independence,
8:22
then others would follow suit.
8:24
However, despite this steer from the African Union's fact-finding mission,
8:28
the countries of Africa were unable to reach a consensus on the issue.
8:34
As a result, Somaliland remained unrecognized in years that followed.
Will it be recognised
8:39
So, a decade and a half later, is there still a chance for it to be recognized?
8:43
On balance, it would seem not - at least not anytime soon.
8:48
On the one hand, it doesn't seem that much has changed in its favour.
8:52
Clearly, the long-standing nervousness about redrawing borders in Africa remains an issue
8:59
- despite the view in the report that it wouldn't open up a precedent.
9:03
Meanwhile, in other ways, things have actually worked against Somaliland.
9:07
Many Western countries, including the United Kingdom, will no doubt be worried about the effects
9:12
of independence on the significant efforts that have been made since 2012 to stabilise and rebuild Somalia.
9:20
There's quite clearly a fear in many quarters that, if Somaliland is allowed to go its own way,
9:25
other parts of the country will try to follow.
9:28
This fracturing could make tackling long-standing problems of warlordism, terrorist groups
9:33
and piracy in Somalia even more difficult.
9:36
Indeed, in recent years, there have been efforts to try to bring the sides into formal peace talks.
9:42
This seems likely to continue into the future.
9:45
And while there is the prospect of talks, even if they are unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable settlement,
9:50
few countries will want to prejudice the outcome by taking a decision on recognition.
9:57
As a counter-argument, leaders in Somaliland argue that other geopolitical factors are now working in their favour
10:03
in terms of recognition.
10:05
For example, there's increasing interest in their port facilities
10:08
- including reports that Russia wants to establish a naval base there.
10:13
While this might have an effect in the future, it's very much in the realm of speculation for now.
Conclusion
10:19
Somaliland is a fascinating case.
10:21
All things considered, it sits in a strange grey zone when it comes to secession.
10:26
Leaving aside its previous existence as an independent state,
10:30
which doesn't officially have a bearing on its claim to independence,
10:33
but does nevertheless seem to shape perceptions about its case,
10:37
it most certainly meets the four conditions for statehood.
10:41
It is a clearly defined territory.
10:44
It has a settled population.
10:45
It has a government - and one that is demonstrably independent.
10:49
And, lastly, it has a proven capacity to enter into relations with other states.
10:55
For all these reasons, one doesn't detect the same sort of hostility towards independence for Somaliland
11:00
as exists in other cases of secession.
11:03
Indeed, many seem to tacitly understand its case for statehood
11:07
and probably sympathise with it given the state of the rest of Somalia.
11:12
As things stand, it seems to be held back by a combination of African concern about secession
11:18
and by wider Western concern about Somalia's stability.
11:23
Ultimately, Somaliland's biggest problem has not been strong opposition to its existence
11:28
as an independent state
11:29
- as is the case in many other examples of secession.
11:33
Instead, as is highlighted by its engagement with the outside world, its real problem has been
11:39
international concern about the implications of formally recognizing that independence.
