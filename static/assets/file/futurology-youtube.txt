there is a country in Africa that almost
0:02
nobody has heard of to understand why it
0:04
exists we must first go back 140 years
0:07
to the Horn of Africa a region then
0:10
referred to as Somaliland in 1884 the UK
0:13
signed agreements with Clans in Northern
0:15
Somaliland to establish a protectorate
0:17
over the region however British interest
0:19
in the region was minimal and as a
0:21
result they mostly stuck to the coast to
0:24
secure meat supplies for their military
0:25
Outpost then five years later in 1889
0:29
along Eastern Somaliland Sultan Yusuf
0:32
Ali Kennedy signed a treaty with Italy
0:35
to make his sultanate of phobio an
0:37
Italian protectorate a year later
0:39
Kennedy's rival Osman Muhammad of the
0:41
major teen sultanate along with the
0:43
galetti sultanate signed similar
0:45
agreements with Italy establishing the
0:47
protectorate of Italian Somaliland over
0:50
the following decades while British
0:51
Somaliland remained mostly undisturbed
0:53
Italian Somaliland underwent a massive
0:56
transformation in 1908 the southern part
0:59
of Italian in Somaliland was turned into
1:01
an official Crown Colony then as fascism
1:04
Rose in Italy during the 1920s and 30s
1:07
Italy took direct control over the
1:09
region and tens of thousands of Italian
1:11
immigrants moved in who built Farms
1:13
hospitals schools roads Railways and
1:17
Cathedrals then World War II broke out
1:19
during the war Italian Somaliland was
1:22
captured by the British and for nine
1:24
years Italian Somaliland remained under
1:26
British military control until 1950 when
1:29
the United Nations granted Italy
1:31
trusteeship over the region however
1:33
around this time a series of
1:35
Independence movements began sweeping
1:38
across the continent in Mogadishu
1:40
somalia's first political party the
1:42
Somali Youth League quickly Rose to
1:44
power and began pushing for self-rule
1:46
then on June 26 1960 British Somaliland
1:50
gained independence five days later
1:52
Italian Somaliland gained independence
1:55
and on July 1st 1960 the two countries
1:58
voluntarily merged together other to
2:00
form the new Somali Republic however the
2:03
territory's different histories
2:05
economies and cultures soon presented a
2:08
major divide throughout the early 1960s
2:10
referendums that had won a majority in
2:12
the South began being rejected by
2:14
Northern Territories and in December
2:17
1961 when Northern paramilitary
2:19
organizations were placed under Southern
2:21
command they revolted the North's second
2:24
largest political party began openly
2:26
advocating for secession by the late
2:28
1960s somalia's political Unity was
2:31
crumbling then on October 15 1969 Somali
2:36
president abdirashid Ali shermark was
2:38
assassinated his death was quickly
2:40
followed by a military coup d'etat which
2:43
placed Major General Muhammad syadbare
2:45
in power over the next decade the Bahari
2:48
regime became increasingly authoritarian
2:51
and in 1977 it invaded the Ethiopian
2:54
region of Ogden before suffering a
2:56
humiliating defeat as soviet-backed
2:59
Cuban forces for Somali troops out this
3:02
Retreat forced the Western Somali
3:04
Liberation Front into Northern Somalia
3:06
where under the support of the Bahrain
3:07
government they antagonized looted and
3:10
attacked local civilians of the Isaac
3:12
ethnic group outraged by this abuse in
3:15
1981 Somali expats in Saudi Arabia and
3:18
the UK formed the Somali national
3:21
movement or s m an organization calling
3:24
for the overthrow of the Bahrain regime
3:26
and the establishment of a just and
3:28
democratic system a year later the s m
3:31
relocated its headquarters to Ethiopia
3:33
where it United with Isaac army officers
3:35
and fighters to form the nucleus of the
3:38
movement's Armed Branch from here the s
3:40
m launched a guerrilla war against the
3:42
Bahrain regime and over the next decade
3:44
completed numerous hit and run and
3:47
rescue operations then in May 1988 the s
3:50
m attacked and captured the city route
3:53
and on May 31st they began an attack on
3:56
hargesa the second largest city in the
3:59
country the city's ISAC population which
4:01
welcomed the s m incursion began being
4:04
arrested and killed by government forces
4:06
and on the third day of fighting the
4:09
government began shelling and bombing
4:11
the city's residents by the time
4:12
fighting stopped up to 90 percent of
4:15
hargesa was destroyed causing hundreds
4:17
of thousands of Isaac civilians to flee
4:20
across the border the cities were soon
4:22
recaptured by Somali forces while the
4:24
attack was unsuccessful and claimed the
4:26
lives of nearly half of all s m Fighters
4:29
the cruelty of the Bahrain regime United
4:31
the Isaac people behind the SNM and
4:34
volunteers began flooding in by June
4:37
1989 the s m was again actively mounting
4:40
attacks across the Northwest in response
4:43
the barrier regime began a mass
4:45
genocidal campaign against the Isaac
4:47
people between 1987 and 1989 an
4:51
estimated 200 thousand members of the
4:54
Isaac tribe were massacred fortunately
4:57
by early 1991 the s m had taken control
5:00
over the vast majority of Northwest
5:02
Somalia and began peace talks with
5:05
Northern Clans meanwhile in southern
5:07
Somalia another Rebel organization
5:09
called the United Somali Congress was
5:12
closing around Mogadishu and on January
5:14
26 1991 the barrier regime collapsed
5:18
with Barre fleeing from Mogadishu to
5:20
Kenya in a tank this collapse left
5:23
behind a power vacuum in soon opposition
5:26
groups began competing for influence
5:28
meanwhile in the north the snc and
5:30
Northern Clans had come to an agreement
5:33
and on May 18 1991 they declared
5:36
independence from the rest of Somalia as
5:38
the new Republic of Somaliland before we

Somaliland
6:43
foreign
6:47
Independence in 1991 Somaliland has
6:50
rebuilt itself and now operates as its
6:52
own sovereign state with a
6:54
democratically elected government as of
6:56
2022 the country covers an area of 177
7:01
000 square kilometers an area slightly
7:03
larger than England and Wales it has a
7:06
quickly growing population of around 5.7
7:08
million people slightly less than
7:11
Denmark its economy which is almost
7:13
entirely reliant on livestock
7:15
agriculture and fishing has the GDP of
7:18
2.6 billion dollars the country has
7:21
hundreds of schools with more than 200
7:24
000 primary and secondary students along
7:26
with seven public and 35 private
7:29
universities somaliland's official
7:31
religion is Islam its official language
7:33
is Somali and it has its own
7:35
Constitution flag currency passports and
7:39
national anthem as a unitary state and
7:41
presidential Republic Somaliland has a
7:44
president vice president Council of
7:46
ministers and a parliament consisting of
7:49
a house of Elders and House of
7:50
Representatives the president is voted
7:52
in by the people and can serve a maximum
7:55
of two five-year terms whereas members
7:57
of parliament are elected by local
7:58
communities and people can serve for
8:01
five and six year terms in essence the
8:03
government is designed as a power
8:05
sharing Coalition of somaliland's main
8:07
Clans with three political parties the
8:10
peace unity and development party the
8:13
justice and Welfare party in the
8:15
Somaliland National Party and while far
8:17
from perfect somaliland's democracy
8:19
serves as a light of freedom and
8:21
stability in a region racked by internal
8:24
conflict and largely devoid of political
8:26
rights and civil liberties it is also
8:29
its own country in pretty much every way
8:32
despite this it is not internationally
8:34
recognized for a host of reasons many
8:37
countries have economic and political
8:39
ties with Somalia that they aren't
8:41
willing to sacrifice and many fear that
8:43
recognizing Somaliland would lead to
8:46
other secessionist movements across
8:48
Africa and for countries like the US and
8:50
many EU countries who are trying to
8:52
stabilize Somalia recognizing Somaliland
8:55
would only complicate the situation as a
8:58
result no country in the world has
9:00
formally recognized Somaliland despite
9:02
this Somaliland has international
9:04
relations with several countries
9:06
including Kenya Ethiopia turkey the UAE
9:10
Taiwan and the UK many of which have
9:13
consulates or Representatives offices in
9:16
the country
The Future
9:21
despite its lack of international
9:23
acceptance smalleyland is working hard
9:25

9:30
potential for both onshore and offshore
9:32
oil and gas reserves as well as metallic
9:35
minerals such as gold copper iron tin

10:01
Somaliland is situated right along one
10:03
of the world's busiest shipping routes
10:05
it is trying to capitalize on this to
10:07
become a global trade Hub linking Inland
10:10
Africa to the rest of the world in 2016
10:13
it signed a 442 million dollar deal with

dubai-based ports manager DP world to
10:20
establish a regional trade and Logistics
10:22

10:27
is rich in natural and prehistoric
10:29
attractions that it hopes will attract
10:31
