1:57
victoria and obviously from previous installments of his conversations with uh with a range of
2:03
interesting people um pretty prior to that he was with the british army for 37 years and
2:11
based all around the world he was a visiting fellow at the university of oxford in the changing character of war
2:16
program and he is was the lead editor of a book called british generals in blair's wars anyway
2:23
thank you both very much for joining us and i'll hand across to you richard
2:29
okay thank you um sarah uh most of our conversation uh this evening uh we'll be exploring why somaliland
2:37
has managed to find and sustain peace uh when the rest of somalia clearly hasn't um and i'll then ask you
2:45
what we're gonna uh what we can learn if anything for some of the world's other seemingly intractable conflicts
2:52
but first i think we need a bit of background about somalia and somaliland both history
2:59
and geography so can we start there oh thanks very much richard and alex for
3:06
hosting me today um uh just sorry just bear with me it's put you into
3:15
there we go sorry about that little zoom issues um yeah thank you very much for hosting me i'm i'm really
3:21
pleased to be here and to see so much interest in in this topic so as you can see from the the map here
3:27
somalia really forms this sort of seven shaped part of east africa it's it um butts up
3:34
against the indian ocean and the red sea and it sits right across from yemen and somaliland is the section that
3:40
is up the in the north western corner now somaliland was more peripheral to the
3:47
british empire than the rest of somalia was to the italian empire so from pointland down to the south had
3:53
been colonized by the italians the italians were by all accounts more brutal in their destruction
4:00
of local governance structures which is not to say that the british were not violent and self-serving just that they
4:05
ran um the protectorate of somaliland at a bit more of a distance
4:10
than the italians did because their main interest in holding territory in somaliland was in supplying livestock
4:18
and meat to arden just across the red sea which was used to supply the colony in india now
4:25
somaliland as i'm sure some of you probably know has never been recognized as a
4:31
sovereign entity by any other state in the international community now they did hold independence for five
4:38
days back in 1960 and this five days has reached i would say almost mythical status when you when you're
4:44
when you're in somaliland people talk about it um as something that can uh was once
4:50
very important and can be reinvigorated because it legally held um status as a state
4:56
uh it had recognition from 34 u.n members um before it voluntarily united five
5:02
days later with the republic of somalia by most accounts the union was pretty
5:08
quickly regretted by those in the north of the country and by 1969 you had a military
5:15
dictatorship or a military officer general sierra buddy overthrow the civilian government and this began sort of 30
5:21
years just over 30 years of military dictatorship which all went particularly
5:27
badly in the north western corner of the country where the asak clan that formed the majority of
5:33
residents there experienced increasingly brutal treatment at the hands of the regime which culminated in
5:40
a bombing campaign in 1998 that's remembered pretty widely by somalilanders as having
5:46
been a genocide so of course brutality was never
5:51
something that prevented a dictator from receiving largesse from the um from either side
5:58
during the cold war but by the time the government of syadbare collapsed in early 1991 somalia had
6:06
become the largest per capita recipient of aid in africa i mean that's that's excluding the tiny
6:11
little states like uh gambia or djibouti but in the main it had become the largest
6:17
per capita recipient of aid in africa which is a pretty um there's some pretty steep competition for that as you might imagine
6:23
and it had held this position since ciard barre swapped sides in the cold war he was
6:28
initially initially affiliated with the soviet union but then in 1978 for a series of reasons
6:34
i won't get into they swap sides to the us and it's really then that the
6:40
extraordinary levels of western economic and military aids are flooding into the country propping up the the government
6:46
in the 1980s bara was finally ousted in 91 and by may of that year
6:51
somaliland declared its independence which as i said has never been formally recognized by any
6:57
other state now as the war waged on in the south in the early 90s which
7:03
is quite famous this is a story that that many people already know and that has been sort of immortalized at least to a western
7:09
audience of my kind of vintage through the movie black hawk down the level of violence that was going on
7:16
in the north that we don't really hear that much about was actually probably even worse so it
7:22
was by no means a foregone conclusion that somaliland's claim of independence was going to put it in any better
7:28
position than the rest of somalia so i'm sure we'll get into this in a little while but um just to
7:34
foreshadow here that somaliland's wars in the 1990s 91 to 96 to be precise were ended
7:41
largely i mean obviously it's more complex than this but just let me put it broadly here and then we can drill down
7:46
it was ended largely by i think two headline processes one of them was
7:52
the large clan based conferences that occurred over quite a number of years and they've
7:58
brought huge numbers of delegates together to negotiate a settlement um and this happened in fits and starts
8:04
and it was disrupted by conflict and then it would restart the other one was president egal's use
8:11
of loans from the country's wealthiest merchants to buy back arms from the warring clan based militias
8:17
and then ultimately reintegrate these mobilized members back into or into a nascent national army
8:27
so um so before we move on to also more detail on how somaliland roots
8:34
can we explore a little bit more uh about somalia and how it has just fallen
8:40
apart you know why has it disintegrated into war and why is it proven so impossible
8:47
for the international community help to help to bring this to an end well i think that the most significant
8:55
difference between somalia and somaliland and the one that i really draw out in the book and it's
9:00
just obvious from its title is the nature of the international presence in both places so at the moment we've had
9:06
18 or possibly possibly more now i lose count at least 18 international conferences that have tried to
9:13
bring peace to somalia and these have tended to be pretty hasty affairs they're usually
9:18
a few days sometimes up to a week or slightly more but they're quick right and somalis tend to
9:25
be pretty poorly represented to them compared to the number of delegates that go from
9:30
other countries as i said before this was not the case for somaliland but i'm going to get into
9:37
that a little more later let's focus here on on somalia in the 1990s there was about four
9:45
billion dollars that the us and the un put into the country in trying to to
9:51
stabilize and end the in the war there what this did though was it contributed to a very profound
9:59
conflict economies so you had international food agencies actually becoming parties to the
10:04
conflict because they were paying belligerence for either protection or for
10:10
humanitarian access and in doing this they provided and this is a pretty common story right
10:15
but in doing this they provided pretty extraordinary opportunities for extortion
10:21
and they really established food aid as an alternative currency as aisha ahmed puts it and so this
10:27
really lays the cornerstone for a very pervasive conflict
10:33
did the food aid also undermine the local agricultural economy absolutely and this is one of the most
10:39
the biggest complaints that you will hear from or it's one of the many but it's certainly
10:44
a headline complaint that you hear from groups like a shabab that they they
10:50
viscerally hate the wfp because it is seen that they were dumping food aid into somalia at times
10:57
when somali's agricultural production and sales should have been the highest so it all contributes to this sense that
11:04
not only is it entrenching a conflict economy but it's also undermining the ability of somalis to
11:10
produce their own food and sustain an agricultural industry so this this point of
11:16
differentiation around external assistance packages is just so deeply scored into
11:23
somaliland's discourse about how its peace process succeeded where somalia's
11:29
failed so if we sit then under this broad differentiation about the international presence and the
11:35
conflict economies that it helped to a trench i think there's a few specific things
11:41
that international actors got pretty wrong in in the very early days and the first one
11:46
was they really profoundly misunderstood clan structures and by misunderstanding
11:52
them they helped to almost reconstruct them redraw them by sort of breathing life into a newly imagined
12:01
version of what a clan really was so somalia's clan structures and this goes for both
12:06
somalia and somaliland i mean it was yet the the system remains the same
12:12
they're often understood as being pretty rigid and unchanging whereas actually they're quite flexible i mean
12:17
they they can be extremely flexible and this is a point that gets lost on most international interveners particularly
12:24
the un in the 1980s and what they did as well was they tended to concentrate resources
12:30
in the major cities and this is something that happens all the time like it's major cities are easier to access
12:35
particularly for foreigners the transport links are better the the general resources are better and
12:41
so what that does though is it provides an incentive for clan elders to relocate out of their local areas and what this
12:48
does is it alters the connection between the elders and the local communities that they were claiming to represent
12:54
and peter little who's a great researcher who's done a fair bit of work on this he talks about the way that terms like
13:01
indigenous clan traditional all become increasingly used by somalis in their
13:09
written statements because they understand that this is language that resonates well with
13:14
external actors and external actors who want to be seen to be engaging with leaders who they believe
13:20
are powerful and locally legitimate so what you get is that as the international presence in
13:25
southern somalia increases you have international agencies adopting this clan idiom and so they start to receive
13:32
proposals from so-called elders even though some of these were really just disguised militia heads
13:39
and peter little did a fair bit of research on this and he said that in 1994 he counted more than 28
13:47
separate clan and sub-clan identities in an area where just 10 years earlier no i think seven
13:53
years earlier he'd identified less than 10. so you see this burgeoning of of clan proclaimed clan identity and
14:00
this was something that that i heard even in 2012 when i was in somaliland and talking to people
14:06
who had just been involved in an international conference in istanbul and this person told me that people you
14:12
know really quickly saw what was going on that they were expected to be tribal elders and so they don the hats of tribal elders
14:19
because that's the language that they realize that the donors are using another trip yeah well another another point
14:28
um just about that that that difference between um north and and south or somaliland and
14:34
the rest of somalia is that there was the un had this really striking preoccupation particularly
14:40
throughout the 90s but you could say that it's also continuing they don't recognize somaliland as an independent
14:46
entity um a really striking preoccupation with maintaining a unitary state with
14:53
mogadishu as the capital and actually as smaller landers were struggling at the most to
14:59
bring the violence in the north under control unisom ii which is the united station united nations mission in
15:06
somalia actually played actors who involved in this peace process against one another
15:12
basically an attempt to try to bring all peacemaking efforts
15:17
back to mogadishu and under un auspices so unisom starts financially supporting
15:23
spoilers to go in and build support for a federal system of government in
15:28
mogadishu by sponsoring these smaller fringe conferences and in doing so they
15:34
endangered the larger and much more inclusive peace processes that were underway at the same time and people
15:39
have said that this is widely believed to have exacerbated the violence in in the north in uh by which i mean
15:46
somaliland 90s now in somalia the u.n has
15:51
really subcontracted if that's the right term um the external um security assistance
15:58
to somali to the african union um and the forces now the african union mission in somalia
16:04
amazon now it's sort of a very much more originally based force
16:10
uh rather than you know from completely out of uh out of the region are they is
16:17
it a more nuanced approach or are they making the same mistakes as we did 20 30 years ago it is a more
16:25
nuanced approach that's that's fair to say but at the same time it is still there is still the well the
16:32
some island hasn't been uh recognized that's one and so there is still this desire to deal with it as
16:37
being one country which creates all sorts of problems on the ground because the somaliland
16:42
governing authorities refuse to accept that but also there is just this i mean fatigue isn't
16:49
even a strong enough word there is just a sense of despair that somalia is still
16:55
experiencing so much intervention from outside and that constrains what they're able to do locally
17:01
politically as well i mean somali of course has had or has
17:07
and has had a number of uh serious problems one of which um
17:12
is it's been the home for quite a long time until recently of a piracy
17:19
in off the horn of africa um now from my background um criminality of
17:26
which piracy is part generally tends to occur in what you know we used to call ungovernment
17:32
space you know rather like the tri-border area in in south america between argentina brazil and paraguay where
17:40
lots of organized crime groups correct group because there's no government space is this
17:47
actually what happened in somalia the piracy was just a response to you know inability to govern the area or
17:53
actually was there something more profound going on or was there more something going on
17:59
so that's an interesting question um what we found in somali uh in in one instance is that
18:06
the areas of pointland which is sort of uh it's its neighbors um neighbor of somaliland sort
18:14
of up the north um of mogadishu that's where he had most of the piracy occurring and actually the
18:20
level of governance was a bit better there than it was in southern somalia because lo and behold pirates
18:26
rather like terrorists find that it's actually pretty difficult to operate when there is absolutely no sort of political control
18:33
so having a not a completely ungoverned space is actually more beneficial for criminal
18:39
entities like pirates uh to to operate you need some level of control
18:45
um but as to whether this was a solely local somali specific problem no um
18:55
piracy in somalia initially emerged at least partly out of the marginalization
19:01
of somalia in the global community so there's a long history to it which i
19:06
obviously don't have too much time to get into now but part of the initial justification that was used by people who were
19:14
boarding ships and calling for ransoms was initially that they were protecting
19:19
somali's international waters from illegal fishing by the international communities that the international community was doing nothing about
19:26
and also against illegal toxic waste dumping so when the tsunami hit in christmas of 2004 you just had a
19:33
tremendous amount of toxic waste even nuclear waste coming up onto the shores of somalia
19:39
which has proved what everybody knew that these were areas that were um being
19:45
abused and preyed upon by um by by international uh by other states and so
19:51
there was this narrative about the need for a somali coast guard to be formed to protect
19:57
the local fishing industry and also protect from from dumping and around about the turn of the century
20:03
you had a british private military contractor heart security go in and train a heap
20:10
of somali fishermen in puntland to do things to help to ward off um you
20:16
know the the international predation so they trained them in things like uh locating vessels at
20:22
sea using the internet uh operating satellite phones gps equipment um boarding moving ships you know all
20:29
these skills that are actually extremely useful for all coast guard skills coast guard skills but when this company
20:35
um went out of business and left somalia all of a sudden these people lost their jobs and many of them went on to become some
20:42
of the most famous pirates interesting now the the other thing which of course
20:48
you know dominates the somalia um um security scene and indeed the rest of
20:54
east africa as an expanding problem in east africa is uh uh the growth of uh radical islam
21:00
and the group al-shabaab and yet somaliland seems to be
21:05
immune to you know the rest of the region uh to this kind to the king to uh al-shabaab
21:12
violence why is this well somaliland did have a few attacks by shabbat there was one against
21:19
the yuan compound in 2008 and then there was an attack in 2013
21:24
that was uncovered like in the final hours of preparation so they do have a presence but yeah
21:30
you're right they haven't they haven't done any of their big attacks there and um
21:36
there's a lot of controversy about this point it's at least there was when i was there sort of around
21:41
2012 2015 people asking the question well why is that why have they why have
21:48
they been seemingly immune from attacks and one of the theories that was doing the
21:53
rounds was that there might be some sort of tacit agreement between members with the somaliland elite um and
22:00
members of shabab now that's that was obviously a very controversial point that many members of
22:06
the government staunchly denied of course the other argument that got raised a lot and i think that has um
22:12
gained more traction is that well it's actually harder to operate in somaliland
22:18
because of the level of community responsiveness to issues like terrorism and piracy that
22:23
people in somaliland want international recognition so much that they don't want to do things
22:29
that would perceive them to be bad international citizens and so there's a strong desire on the part of
22:35
the community to report this sort of behavior and to stamp it out locally
22:40
so there's very differing opinions on on that interesting so let's let's look now at how
22:46
somaliland found peace if you like um now
22:52
many of the things that you know commentators or some commentators ascribe to being you know there's contributing to the
22:57
somali uh conflict you know the clan structure and some intrinsically uh uh violent
23:04
uh aspect to the somali nature supposedly are also present of course in somaliland and yet somali land
23:12
managed to end its war and find peace how did that happen
23:18
again i think the cleanest point of comparison between the two places is the nature and the degree of
23:25
international intervention in uh that both experienced and the fact that somaliland was very unusually detached from
23:32
international power structures so i'm not just talking about aid even though that's the title of the book because otherwise the title would have been too
23:39
long but i'm talking about international money so they didn't have access to international loans from the imf
23:45
which meant that they had no debt that needed to be serviced but also they had no access to legal international weapons trade
23:53
which has a big impact on a government's capacity to wage violence on the capacity of
24:00
militias to be formed but i think also probably most importantly there was no party that was trying to either end
24:07
or benefit from somaliland's wars and that's actually extremely unusual in the contemporary era to not
24:14
have external parties who are trying whether tacitly or overtly to benefit from a war
24:21
because somaliland wasn't recognized it wasn't seen as a particularly consequential
24:26
part of the world geostrategic concerns looked pretty different 30 years ago to how they look
24:31
now it's a very different story now and it's in a very politically and economically pivotal part of the
24:37
world but that wasn't so much the case 30 years ago and the lack of international
24:43
involvement which again stemmed largely from this lack of international interest frankly meant
24:49
that unlike the places that get targeted by international peace building international state
24:55
building interventions the process that unfolded in somaliland to end the violence evolved without
25:03
any explicitly explicit expectations of how it should look there were no
25:09
schedules that needed to be met and there was no technical indicators of success the clan conferences that
25:15
i've referred to before they took as long as they needed to take sometimes this meant they took
25:20
many months and there was lots of starts and stops there's one great story of the beginning
25:25
of the conference in bottom which is probably the most important one in 1993 being delayed for quite some time
25:32
because of political wrangling between some of the some of the key elites and so people there was a week dedicated
25:39
to just quran recitations like you can never imagine that happening in in something that is being
25:44
overseen or presided over by the un or others in the international community and you also had um you know the chair
25:51
people to the conferences they would fall ill in order to allow time and political space for people to
25:57
come together outside of the formal space of the of the conferences but another
26:05
so so and so that they had their own they would set their own pace in negotiations but also crucially
26:12
as you made point um there's no external cash to be made by continuing the war and so
26:20
much of uh the energy that goes into uh into conflict um which is that all about
26:26
money the loss which is about money uh just simply was absent yeah and the peace process was also
26:32
locally funded as well so there was one of the conferences took about five months there was two
26:38
thousand delegates and it was hosted by the gadabolosi clan and everyone there knew hey this was an
26:44
extraordinary expense that they were putting into this process but they knew that reciprocity was somewhere down the line going to be expected so don't waste
26:51
time this is local resources going into a local process now i mentioned that there was about
26:57
four billion dollars that was poured into the southern parts of somalia by the us and the un
27:03
in the 90s other than about a hundred thousand dollars um there was nothing that went into
27:10
somaliland's peace conference and one thing that i find fascinating about this is that even the mention of the hundred
27:17
thousand dollars is something that raises controversy within somaliland i gave a public talk
27:22
there in 2015 and there was quite a few people there who'd read a previous piece that i'd written which mentions this
27:28
figure of a hundred thousand dollars and a number of people were really pushing me on it like where did you get this figure
27:34
about we don't think that there was anything there was nothing because it's such an important part of the
27:39
national narrative of their independence that they did this with no aid
27:44
amusingly the person who actually delivered the hundred thousand dollars um from the donors happened to be in the
27:49
audience as well um but just the idea that even a hundred thousand dollars was
27:55
was a point of controversy that because it upset this narrative of independence was really fascinating to me
28:02
i mean there are obviously some cases where actually international assistance or
28:08
external influence and assistance has helped to end conflicts i'm thinking now for
28:13
example in northern ireland the person intervention by bill clinton was absolutely critical in bringing people together um
28:21
um but this is a a really interesting case where actually the the absence of
28:30
international intervention was critical in terms in terms of ending the war um
28:36
but it's one thing to find peace uh quite another to sustain it um as somaliland has done now for some
28:43
25 years i think um how has it achieved that especially given that the fragility of the state's
28:49
institutions you know such as police and judiciary et cetera
28:54
this that's a great question and and this is where i think i really deviate from the mainstream literature
29:00
on somaliland and also on peace building more generally because this tends to
29:05
credit either the state apparatus that gets formed in somaliland for being able to perform
29:10
this maintenance of political order or it's credited to the clan or it gets
29:16
credited to what's referred to as somaliland's hybrid system which is probably best understood as like this fruitful
29:22
combination of the clan and formal organizations what i think is really doing this work
29:30
though was a deeper understanding of their own precarity and the ease with which their situation
29:37
could become like mogadishus again and so in a sense i think the ability to sustain peace
29:44
has not been so much despite the fragility of its institutions but actually in many ways because of them
29:51
because of the fragility of their institutions and we could look at the 2003 presidential elections as an
29:59
example of this there was initially a vote a difference between the two candidates of just 80 votes
30:05
out of 500 000 that were cast so as you can imagine this was really tense and people
30:10
many people were expecting that there could be a violent outcome the rhetoric from both sides of the
30:16
of the election turned to being very much about not following mogadishu and seeing that
30:22
if they did choose to mobilize for violence that's where it could end so you've got this example
30:28
of mogadishu being used in a very real and tangible way to stave off the possibility of
30:34
violence in somaliland and of course it did it did pass peacefully so what i take from this
30:39
is that the ability of state or formal institutions to sustain
30:46
the monopoly on the legitimate use of violence which is of course the the standard definition of a state but
30:51
it's also the standard um understanding of the way that political order
30:56
is sustained it's just not true in the case of somaliland and i think you could actually argue and i do argue
31:04
that it's the weakness of its institutions that gets used kind of quite counter-intuitively as a reason
31:11
to sustain the peace i think i think your your comments on um the
31:17
lack of monopoly of force that you made in your book um one of the many insights which by the
31:22
way i thoroughly enjoyed um i think was one of the um most you know what
31:27
something that was really interesting to me and i can have any examples of how it actually
31:32
works how does how do how does policing justice actually work
31:38
so i can give you a really interesting example of a case that took place when i was
31:44
there in 2012 a conflict that the government got involved in but not in the way
31:49
that you know anyone in you or my background would expect them to do so there was a case when uh someone was
31:57
killed by a you know a member of a clan um and the clan elders you know the the
32:05
perpetrator the killer's clan elders didn't try to or didn't succeed i'm not sure
32:10
in capturing the suspect okay now that's a customary requirement for interclan negotiations to to start
32:17
so this creates a deadlock and people were expecting that a revenge killing by the victims clan was probably
32:24
on the cards it's here that the the minister of internal affairs steps in and he steps in to try
32:30
and break the deadlock and he issues an ultimatum to the offenders clan
32:35
to either capture the offender capture the the murder um so that investigations can take place
32:42
or negotiations rather or they're all going to be arrested at no time though did the minister actually
32:48
suggest that the government forces would attempt to intervene in order to investigate or arrest the suspect the suspect was
32:55
free and uh you know he wasn't recaptured and so the minister carried good on the
33:00
ultimatum and briefly arrests the elders from from his clan
33:06
once they were released the minister then explains that what he had done he had done in order to persuade the
33:11
victim's clan members to delay their revenge um and to convince the elders
33:17
from the murderers clan that that it was up to them to prosecute the crime so what we see is that the government
33:24
authorities in this story they have played a mediating role but they're using their coercive capacity to detain
33:30
the elders and kind of you know twist their arms into negotiating a solution
33:35
that is actually going on outside of the government's judicial institutions um they are not trying to
33:42
divert the dispute into its own jurisdiction they're completely fine with it happening elsewhere and i think that
33:48
this reveals that the government hasn't established a monopoly on the legitimate
33:54
use of force that i think a lot of people presume it to and they sort of hold up as being
33:59
the reason that somaliland has been able to sustain its peace but i think it also shows
34:04
that it's not necessarily actively seeking that either how important
34:11
is moving on a little how important is the idea that what they call the
34:18
independence discourse you know they're continuing seeking of independence uh
34:23
to their maintenance of peace that's yeah that's that's a
34:29
controversial issue some people in some island were quite open and said look the lack of independence
34:35
has been a blessing in disguise others completely disagree with that i hasten to add but but some see it as this really awkward
34:42
dilemma or even paradox that it has been the lack of independence that has helped them to sustain
34:48
peace and that if they get independence then there will be a lot more international intervention or
34:54
international money international access flowing in and that could upset the apple court but that is that is a matter of huge debate within
35:01
somaliland but the idea that somaliland was able to negotiate and maintain its
35:08
peace in considerable part because of its independence not only from somalia but also from the international
35:15
community is a really powerful one even though it's really important to point out the idea that it actually doesn't have
35:21
any money flowing in from the international community now is not true there's u.n trucks all over the place
35:27
there's lots and lots of foreign money flowing in there but for the first 10 years
35:32
that really wasn't the case until it's become part of their national narrative absolutely
35:40
so i'm going to move now on to sort of really our last question um as you've explained
35:47
uh somaliland's uh peace is largely born out of reaction to its own war
35:53
um and to justify its claims to independence you know by showing it's peaceful and different to mogadishu and
35:59
the rest of somalia um it engaged its own social structures and traditions to build the mechanisms
36:05
for peace it was left to do that by the international community
36:10
and the very weakness of its formal state institutions um helps to sustain the peace
36:17
now at face value to me these look like a very specific recipe
36:23
for peace that wouldn't necessarily be immediately transferable elsewhere so how can the lessons
36:31
of somaliland be more broadly applicable
36:36
um so first i think the fact that somaliland was so unusually detached from the
36:43
international system in just about every way during its first formational years that is like it's about its first
36:49
10 or so um and the years of its peace process i think really highlights just how possible autonomous
36:57
development all autonomous peace building really is and this is something that international
37:02
discourses about security and about development just profoundly ignore there's almost always this
37:10
assumption that external involvement in processes of peace or state building are invariably useful you've just got to
37:16
tinker with them to make them a bit better but they're always useful and i don't think that this is necessarily true and i
37:23
i talk a lot to yemenis that's another area that i cover a lot and one of the things that i'm hearing a lot now is the
37:29
the frustrated view that if they were left to their own devices they'd actually be quite capable of
37:34
negotiating a workable settlement to the conflict like that's we can get into that later but it's a
37:39
very very strongly felt sentiment but going going deeper
37:45
i think that the hope of finding directly applicable lessons that can be
37:50
transported between cases and we see this a lot like i'm often asked about you know what are the what are the lessons that we can take
37:56
from somaliland and apply elsewhere i think that in one way it kind of reveals this desire within the scholarly
38:03
and practitioner community to find specific social outcomes that can be engineered but this often doesn't work
38:10
very well we tend to be fairly bad at um at social engineering so i guess what i'm
38:17
suggesting is that we look instead at the much bigger picture lessons that
38:22
somaliland's experience does contain one of the most obvious of which is the local context local agency local
38:30
identity is invariably part of any political process right the social world is never
38:35
linear and despite this development models state building models are very linear
38:40
but i think that's kind of it's a bit of a dissatisfying answer you know that context matters so
38:46
we've got to let context happen that doesn't really tell us that much that is directly transferable other than there's
38:52
probably going to be unintended consequences but for a long time when i was first starting to write the book i
38:59
basically thought that that was where the book story was going to end that external intervention inhibits
39:05
contextually important people and contextually important processes from emerging
39:10
and that the overriding presumption that international intervention is a valuable contribution is is limiting to
39:16
development processes now that's a thread that runs through the book but then i realized that there was something that had been staring me
39:22
in the face throughout all the field work that i did and that was that this is
39:27
i think a story about a lot more than just the importance of local allowing
39:32
local context to determine the development process um i think that
39:38
what somaliland's experience helps us to see is that many of the things that development and
39:44
security scholars and and practitioners have so long presumed about the way that peace
39:50
and order emerges and endures are actually fundamentally wrong the usual assumption i think is
39:56
that political order increases that's basically in in lockstep with the increases that are
40:02
made to the capacity of either state or state-like institutions but what somaliland shows us
40:08
is that this presumption can actually be flipped on its head and if it can be flipped on its head and
40:14
it can be i think because the precarity of its institutions also underpin its political order then
40:20
we were never looking at a causal relationship to begin with so my claim here is that
40:26
political order is never actually a simple function of either state or state-like
40:31
institutional capacity but it's far more it's about the far more
40:36
slippery discourses that give these institutions life and so this suggestion really challenges the common
40:42
sense causal relationship between institutions and order because if either either the strength of
40:49
an institution or the weakness of an institution can provide a foundation of order
40:54
then then there was never really a causal relationship between them it's correlative perhaps but it's not causal
41:01
and this has really important implications because beyond somaliland because if weak institutions
41:06
can also support order under certain conditions in this case discursive conditions then
41:13
we see just how inherently fluid this relationship is and this shows us as well just how
41:20
susceptible to rapid change in our institutions are and i think that this is the
41:25
the point that i would really like people to take away from all this and that i'll end on is that the institutions
41:33
and states that we in the west tend to label as being fragile
41:38
are actually a lot closer to our own robust effective constraining whatever
41:44
you want to call them institutions than we like to imagine and it's when the norms and the
41:50
discourses that give these institutions legitimacy deteriorate as i think we're seeing happen
41:56
across the world now things can change very quickly because we were never actually dealing with a simple causal
42:02
relationship that we thought that we were the relationship is always mediated by ideas and the ways that people
42:08
express these ideas in language and practice and language and ideas change really fast so i think that
42:14
we do well to understand them as the real foundation for peace and political order
42:21
well i i i i enjoyed your analysis about how um the into
42:28
the very presence of the international community and everything it brings with it in um
42:34
local politics substantially changes the local political scene and indeed can
42:41
undermine the legitimacy of what are perceived as traditionally as being
42:46
legitimate leaders and orders and that's something that we simply
42:52
don't understand but how we impact and the other aspect about aid which uh
43:00
which i reflect from my west african experience um that came out of your book was that
43:07
um since most aid is channeled through government local governments it makes
43:16
taking ownership of that government really rewarding which is the reason why
43:21
we had so many coups and continue to do so uh in in some african countries
43:28
uh because there is money to be made out of it um and absent that aid
43:35
there just wasn't that incentive to try and overthrow government and smiling and i think
43:40
that's a really really interesting [Music] insight is there anything you would like
43:46
to add or before we throw open to to to q a ah look i think
43:51
that was very comprehensive thank you let's let's open it up to questions from thank you okay okay alastair we've got
43:58
some great questions coming and we'll get through as many as we can i'm going to just take sort of two together
44:04
to kick off if if a lack of international aid had helped somaliland can a lack of international
44:12
recognition damage its peace and progress so so leading from that what are the prospects for somaliland
44:18
obtaining international recognition and does eritrea's separation from ethiopia provide
44:24
a relevant precedent um what are the prospects of it gaining
44:31
international recognition look if the the recognition of eritrea and the recognition of south sudan was greeted
44:38
with great fanfare uh within somaliland because it was seen as being look this is pandora's
44:43
box being opened we can start to recognize secessionist entities the difference between those cases
44:48
though was that uh the secession was signed off in the capital um whereas somalia will not sign off on on
44:56
position with somaliland there's there has been no indication that they will do that so i think that would require
45:02
then the international community leading on taking it through the u.n which i just don't
45:07
see happening um there was a question as well about what recognition might
45:14
mean for somaliland a really hotly debated um
45:19
question i mean the obvious answer is that people would be thrilled because this is very much what their entire
45:25
international posturing and discourse is about but i think i certainly picked up very clear
45:33
concerns about what would happen and part of the tension within the discourse is that it does recognize that you know
45:39
we did this by our own hand we negotiated our piece under a tree while somalis did it in a
45:45
five-star hotel in nairobi many people realized that that is likely to be upset
45:50
if and when international recognition was to come so there is a sense of trepidation i think as well
45:56
um but of course that that can get um there is also a great enthusiasm just
46:02
for the idea of recognition but i i often wonder if it became more likely
46:07
to be a reality how people would feel about that absolutely you'd mentioned yemen and
46:13
then obvious question is which has been upvoted how has the war in yemen affected somaliland
46:21
well in many ways um principally that just the strategic nature of the
46:27
region has just been amplified i mean it has been um increasing for quite some time
46:32
particularly with the uh the chinese involvement and belton road uh the emirates wanting anyway to expand
46:40
their presence in ports across across the region but also in the possibility of somaliland being
46:47
providing military bases for the war in yemen so it's just
46:52
amplified the sense that this is a strategically important area there's also been a lot of flow of
46:59
um of refugees between the two which was always the case but it was previously in the opposite direction but
47:04
now you're having yemenis going over to somalia more than was ever the case before
47:12
but based on your research in the region what would you say the necessary
47:18
conditions that the international community should consider before contemplating whether or not to support
47:25
the potential division of an existing state look i think you've got to base it on
47:31
what the local population wants and i think that is part of the reason that is the reason mainly why the
47:37
international community is unwilling to lead this they want it you know if it was to be led by
47:42
mogadishu and hager then that would be a different story and that is what happened in in the two previous cases that i
47:48
referred to before but i think that nobody has the appetite or the interest to to lead a process like this so i
47:55
think until there is settlement between the two capitals little will change and certainly when
48:01
we're sorry just to uh to intrude when i was working in mogadishu uh they uh there was
48:09
absolutely convinced that the somalilanders i can call that were somalis
48:17
it's just something they wouldn't even consider i think i'm right in saying that absolutely yeah yeah no people yes it is
48:24
considered treason by by many somalis the idea that they are calling for their own state yeah
48:29
it's not something that i can ever imagine mogadishu saying yes to
48:36
i've read one comment that women had played a particular role in in solving some of the
48:41
the problems could you just briefly talk a little bit more about that and how that came about an extremely important role and i'm
48:48
sorry i didn't get a chance to go into it um previously but look women were
48:54
they weren't formally involved in most of the negotiations in fact they were cut out and but what they did do is like women so
49:02
often do is much of the heavy lifting behind the scenes so they were involved in basically cajoling the men to take part
49:09
in the negotiations and some of them have told me how you know we stopped cooking we stopped
49:14
taking care of the kids until they said that they would go back and negotiate in good faith um and so they also women have a really
49:23
interesting structural role in clan based societies like somalia's um in that one when a woman gets married
49:30
she's not uh she does not take on uh she does not lose the clan of her birth so she
49:36
becomes a member of her husband's clan but she doesn't lose the clan of her birth so she's a member of two clans whereas men are men
49:41
are only the a member of the clan of their birth which means that they can perform and i'm always a
49:47
bit hesitant of giving such a structuralist answer but so take this with something of a grain of salt but um
49:53
women because of they maintain two clan identities in times of conflict they are the behind the scenes
49:58
negotiators because they can move between the various clans and it's just a normal thing and they
50:04
are very much involved in trying to bring um bring the warring parties together and their their
50:09
conflict their their contribution rather was was extraordinary and is increasingly being credited more as
50:16
being so that's really interesting good to pick
50:21
out so if if local social processes and structure is so paramount
50:27
do you see a role for external actors in in peace building to an extent yes but i think that the
50:34
most useful thing that they can probably do and i guess i'm thinking this very much with my eyes on yemen which is my
50:39
other real interest is that they could provide they can provide
50:45
political space you know they can provide um the ability for people to come
50:52
together without um without so much pressure i think and sort of hold back
50:57
the tide of other international actors that might want to be involved and sort of really try to to
51:02
protect a level of political space for uh for local negotiations to
51:07
occur but they need to accept that this is a really bumpy process it happens in fits and starts over long periods of
51:13
time but that time needs to be protected and i think that's a role that they can usefully play but that's typically not
51:20
what they do they go much much further than that absolutely um if i could just
51:26
also add um and there have obviously have been cases uh where conflicts have
51:34
been brought to a close with international assistance as obviously as you said
51:39
earlier no silver bullet no lesson that is absolutely specific um
51:44
in you know sierra leone for example the war wouldn't have ended without nigeria's assistance
51:50
um uh nor indeed in the end with the united nations bringing the two sides together to uh
51:56
oversee the uh uh the disarmament process um i don't think the the local syrians will
52:03
be able to do that by themselves i don't think um so there there are obviously
52:08
uh times when external assistance might be necessary and other times when it were really unhelpful would you would
52:15
you with that as a generalization sarah do you think i've gone too far
52:21
cautiously yes but i think what gets us into a lot of trouble is and i'm not talking about you i'm
52:27
saying more generally the presumption that international assistance will be of use and so now we start our peace
52:33
building process and this gets driven by this but you know by this entity or the u.n or whatever and i think that is profoundly damaging
52:40
and i think it often happens way too soon before there has been sort of a chance for um
52:46
for local actors to to really come together with something on the line you know with something serious on the line
52:52
so i i don't want to say that it is it is never useful i mean you know there are no certain bullets and there are no cookie
52:59
cutter answers neither saying never any assistance or always assistance is obviously going to
53:04
to answer this but allowing space for the political and contextual complexities to sort of
53:11
work their way i think is really really important and the international community for all sorts of structural reasons has
53:17
real difficulties in being able to see that through the way that the way that um the un and
53:24
other ingos and foreign ministries and aid agencies are structured you know you're there for a year you're there for two years you
53:30
pick you tick off things on your um you know to advance your career um you are not rewarded for
53:37
being in one place for a long period of time and really getting to know it you're rewarded for being a generalist
53:43
so that tends to mean that people um from the international side lack the level of
53:49
contextual in detail about a specific case so it's all these sorts of things that can
53:54
can lead into it but no i would i'm not saying that there is one completely right or one completely
53:59
wrong answer and there can be a role for external assistance sometimes in in bringing people together
54:06
just following on briefly so from your your comment on women and and how that works with the the clans are the clans in somaliland
54:14
much different to those in puntman for example or other other parts of somalia to yeah look
54:21
sometimes people will argue that the reason that somaliland has had peace is because they're all
54:26
from the the majority is you know the the majority is from one clan and that's
54:32
something of a factor but then keep in mind that throughout the 90s it was the asak subclans that were engaged in a
54:38
just a terrible terrible violence so the idea that they all came together because they were
54:44
isak just i think doesn't doesn't hold um historical the historical evidence
54:50
doesn't doesn't show it but um so yeah there is a there is a dominant um
54:55
clan within somaliland but structurally no very very similar
55:01
do you have a feeling for what role the international diaspora is playing and promoting economic growth
55:07
and and how how much influx is there back from overseas to to somaliland
55:14
the majority of people's incomes come from the diaspora like that is how money largely comes into the
55:20
country um people are sending remittances is in uh there's no there's no definitive
55:26
um estimation of what that is but it seems like it's probably at least let's say between
55:33
500 and a thousand percent of what the government's annual budget would be it's huge i mean that is that is how
55:39
uh many somalilanders and somalis and and africans and middle eastern you know it's very common but this is how many of
55:46
them um have their livelihoods and and is um is international tourism
55:53
playing any sort of role there international tourism yeah uh it's tiny um but it is you know
56:01
there are certainly people who go there for for tourism but it's it's it's a small part of their
56:07
economy they would like it to grow and it's great you should go
56:13
absolutely um okay just coming back to the to the clan conferences because there's quite a lot of interest in this
56:19
did any natural leader emerge out of that because the
56:24
situation in a different straw with with lebanon for example where there are you know people tribal class
56:32
differences that there's no leader rise yet but was that the case in somaliland there were natural leaders coming out of
56:37
this yes um and also though the second president president was a capable leader and he was also he
56:45
was very good at getting money out of the wealthy merchants and using that to reasonably developmental ends um
56:53
so that that is a that is a difference they also had um a a group
56:59
of people who were reasonably well educated from one particular secondary school and these the
57:06
alumni from this institution go on to form the majority or let's say about a third
57:11
of every cabinet that somaliland has ever had like they're very very influential and active within the bureaucracy
57:20
and just to come out here what what is the main economy there in some island we may have covered up a couple of
57:27
questions just it's livestock is the main one but then there's lots of people circling around looking for a uh for oil
57:33
because it's believed that there are large oil deposits um both within the country but also mainly off the coast
57:40
and so if that happens if there are large oil deposits discovered i think all bets
57:45
are off everything changes if they are proven and they are extractable
57:50
yeah i mean you talked well richard had raised the question about piracy and obviously some you know
57:56
incredible seamanship among the people there to go do what they were doing all bit nefarious so has has the coast
58:04
guard um come back in any shape or form as a source of employment for them no not really um
58:12
and even in somaliland where there was very limited uh incidence of piracy it did happen on
58:18
a number of occasions but it was very limited they don't have or at least when i was doing my last interviews around this a
58:24
few years ago they didn't have a functioning coast guard it was basically the coast guard didn't have boats or they had tiny tiny little boats they
58:30
relied on reports from members of the community you know hey i think this guy is organizing
58:35
something do something it wasn't a matter of them patrolling out at sea
58:42
well we're coming to the to the end of our time maybe maybe we can squeeze in a couple of brief uh last last question
58:49
but um the the situation in ethiopia the some of the unrest there is is that having an impact across the
58:56
border well yes i mean they share they share a border so that is a flick affecting um you know some of the some
59:03
of the um the crossovers there but i couldn't give you any more details and that's something that's a little bit out of
59:09
out of my area no no problem maybe we can get one last question and apologies
59:14
to anyone if we can't get yours in but we've covered a lot but just on on the on the whole sort of
59:19
peace process what was there uh any type of formal truth and reconciliation structure going
59:26
on there or was it coming from the clans no not really i mean it's
59:31
it was a it was a very open and inclusive process at the clan conferences and they explicitly made a
59:39
um a promise that they weren't going to go after people who had done them wrong in um
59:45
during the conflict there's a there's a somali term haledale which i may be mispronouncing
59:51
um that is basically saying that there will be um if there are no if if the losses from
59:57
war are so incalculable you know so huge that they can't be calculated and they cannot be reciprocity you've just
1:00:03
