somaliland lies on the horn of africa
0:02
colonized by britain in the 19th century
0:05
it became an independent state on the
0:07
26th of june 1960
0:09
and was recognized by over 30 countries
0:11
however
0:12
just five days later on the first of
0:14
july 1960 it united with italian
0:17
somaliland
0:18
to form the somali republic but the
0:20
union soon turned sour
0:21
as somaliland's autonomy was stripped
0:23
away as somalia fell into civil war at
0:26
the start of the 1990s
0:28
somaliland seized the opportunity to
0:30
reclaim its independence on the 18th of
0:32
may
0:32
1991. in the years that followed it
0:36
pressed its case for recognition
0:38
in 2005 an african union mission argued
0:41
that some island has a case for
0:42
recognition
0:43
as it was unique and self-justified in
0:46
african political history
0:48
although somaliland enjoys good
0:49
relations with a number of countries
0:51
and despite existing as a de facto state
0:54
for 30 years
0:55
it still remains wholly unrecognized on
0:57
the world stage
