Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 10
FOREWORD
The Government of Somaliland has developed successive development plans to address
its national development challenges. The National Development Plan (NDP III,
2023-2027) is a medium-term strategy designed to unlock the country's potential in
all sectors of the economy to achieve inclusive, sustainable development and poverty
reduction. The NDP III builds on the achievements and lessons learned during the
NDP II period (2017-2021), which concluded in December 2021, and aims to achieve
the socio-economic transformation envisioned in the Somaliland National Vision 2030.
During the NDP II period, the country grappled with external shocks and the persistent
drought in the sub-region. The global shock of the COVID-19 pandemic taught Somaliland
– and the entire world – the importance of building resilience in the economy,
especially for the poor and vulnerable. As such, one of the notable updates to the
NDP III is the addition of the Social Protection sector and climate change adaptation
alternatives to strengthen the economy's resilience to recurrent shocks.
The NDP III envisages a diversified and resilient economy anchored on the principles
of sustainable development. The plan prioritizes physical and human capital development
as conduits to economic development. The NDP III will include significant investments
to uplift infrastructure, mining and extractives, water facilities, and food security, and build on achievements in the health and
education sectors. As in the past, the government’s investments in the overall governance architecture remain high, as no meaningful
development can occur without democracy and the rule of law. The NDP III has many strategies to support economic development
by improving the business environment for the active participation of domestic investors and attracting foreign direct investment. The
plan will continue to emphasise easing the process for registering businesses through one-stop shops, enhancing financing conditions,
improving energy access, and lowering costs to reduce the burden on businesses.
The NDP III outcomes and cost estimates are the aspirations of the various sectors and government institutions over the next five years.
The plan is meant to clarify the direction and structure of Somaliland’s national development, providing common ground for dialogue,
facilitating the participation of a wide range of stakeholders and development partners, and promoting synergies to achieve shared
goals. In this context, an essential precondition of successful implementation is "mutual alignment". As the government is committed to
aligning resources from the national budget with the NDP III, development partners are encouraged to follow suit based on international
principles of development cooperation, as enshrined in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.
As part of the NDP III implementation strategy, the government has initiated a National Development Fund (NDF) that is based on
transparent and accountable governance principles to facilitate joint financing of priority interventions. The government will engage
with development partners to build the NDF into a central financing mechanism for Somaliland's long-term development.
The implementation of the NDP III will also involve the government engaging with its development partners and inviting them to jointly
formulate National Flagship Programmes (NFPs) with clearly defined plans, budgets, implementation arrangements, and committed
finances. These NFPs are designed to address the following priorities:
• Boosting Somaliland's economic and private sector development and exploring and maximizing opportunities and multiplier
effects created by recent significant private sector investments.
• Improving the resilience and livelihoods of agro-pastoral and pastoral communities in areas most vulnerable to climate change
and recurring droughts.
• Developing climate-smart infrastructure in partnership with local governments and the private sector to improve access to
affordable services crucial for developing value chains and private sector initiatives, such as energy, water, roads, information
and communications technology, and markets, among others.
• Broadening and accelerating support to the decentralisation process that was started with support from the UN Joint Programme
on Local Governance (JPLG).
The government will commit sufficient resources to monitor the NDP III during its implementation. All ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs) are called upon to reinforce their internal capacity to continuously monitor progress through outcome targets and
annual operational benchmarks. A separate NDP III Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning (MEAL) supplement provides
technical guidance to MDA staff to harmonise monitoring and reporting efforts across government institutions. The learning from
the mid- and end-term evaluations will offer vital recommendations for the formulation of Somaliland's next Vision Paper. It is critical
that monitoring and evaluation are conceived and implemented as joint exercises, leading to broad ownership of conclusions and
recommendations.
Finally, I want to reiterate the importance of alignment by all stakeholders in terms of objectives, choice of interventions, financial
commitments, institutional and implementation arrangements, and monitoring and reporting on progress. I am confident that with the
spirit of alignment, the NDP III will successfully improve the lives of my fellow citizens.
H.E. Muse Bihi Abdi
President of the Republic of Somaliland
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 1
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The preparation of the National Development Plan III (NDP III, 2023-2027) has been
inclusive and participatory to include the needs and priorities of different districts and
regions in Somaliland. The NDP III preparation benefited from the lessons learned from
the NDP II, resulting in the formulation of a plan that will guide the achievement of
national development priorities. The methodology involved consultation with a wide
range of stakeholders to collect inputs into the formulation of the plan, while the ministries,
departments, and agencies of the government, together with the Ministry of
Planning and National Development’s (MoPND’s) technical team, have developed the
sector chapters of the plan. To increase local ownership, diverse participants, including
government representatives, the private sector, youth, women, people with disabilities,
traditional leaders, religious leaders, and other groups were all involved in the NDP III
preparation process. This process was only possible with the significant contributions of
a wide variety of stakeholders who helped guide and validate the NDP III. The MoPND
recognises the commitment and continued support of the President of the Republic
of Somaliland to the NDP III preparation process. The MoPND is also grateful to the
National Planning Committee, who oversaw and advised the preparation process.
I would like to recognise my predecessors' efforts who laid the groundwork for the NDP III preparation. I also express my sincere
gratitude to the NDP III technical team for their incredible efforts and perseverance in delivering the project. I want to particularly thank
the core team, including Technical Team Leader Khadar Ahmed Abdi Gadhere, M&E Expert Antony Christiaan van de Loo, Economic
Development Expert Momodou K. Dibba, and Nimo Ahmed Ismail for their hard work and leadership in delivering the project. In
addition to their leadership roles, Mr. Van de Loo and Mr. Dibba also served as cross-cutting consultants for all NDP III chapters. I also
want to thank the Director General of the Ministry, Mr. Ahmed Yasin Muhumed Hasan, and other technical team members, sector leads,
and support staff mentioned in Annex 6 who also contributed to this project.
On behalf of the Government of Somaliland, I want to thank the Somaliland Development Fund (SDF), which made a significant technical
and financial contribution to the NDP III preparation, and the United Nations agencies who provided financial and advisory support
at different stages of the NDP III process. I also want to recognise Plan International Somaliland's financial contribution to the quality
assurance and graphic design of the NDP III document and all the organisations and people who readily gave their time, information,
and perspectives to contribute to preparing the NDP III.
Finally, implementing the NDP III requires enormous financial and technical resources. The President of the Republic of Somaliland H.E.
Muse Bihi Abdi and the MoPND fully understand this challenge and commit to successfully implementing this development strategy.
The implementation arrangements are built on existing institutional structures, which increases the sustainability and impact of the
development programmes.
Hon. Dr. Ahmed Adan Ahmed Buhane
Minister of Planning and National Development
BACKGROUND & CONTEXT
Chapter 1
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 3
1.1 Introduction
In 1991, Somaliland had the enormous task of building a
functional state after the devastating effects of the civil war
that caused tremendous damage to the country. With determination,
successive governments laid the foundations
upon which to build future developments.
Thus, the country’s development evolved out of a process
of more than twenty years of grassroots peacebuilding and
state-building. Over this time, the Somaliland government
started engaging a range of international partners, including
the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, Norway, the
Netherlands, the European Union, the World Bank, the
African Development Bank, and a range of United Nations
agencies and national and international non-governmental
organisations (NGOs/INGOs).
The first joint effort to work towards a common understanding
of the priorities of Somaliland was the 2006 Joint
Needs Assessment (JNA), leading to the 2007-2010 Reconstruction
and Development Plan (RDP), conducted together
with the United Nations and the World Bank.
These processes informed the thinking behind Somaliland’s
first National Development Plan (NDP I, 2012-2016).
The then Ministry of National Planning and Development
(MoPND) went on to develop the Somaliland Vision 2030.
NDP I was written to operationalise the country’s vision and
communicate with citizens and the diaspora.
At the start of NPD I, Somaliland was considered, by World
Bank estimates, to be one of the poorest countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa, with a per capita Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) of US$347. At the time, this was the fourth lowest
in the world, ahead of Malawi, the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, and Burundi.
With perseverance and much needed reforms, including
improved budgeting and planning of domestic resources,
the National Development Plan II (2017-2021) achieved
steady growth for the period, with GDP per capita increasing
from US$557 to US$775. Compared to initial estimates
in 2012, this is a jump from the fourth poorest country in the
world to the eighteenth poorest in the world.
This steady growth has caused changes to the structure
of the economy. Although still largely pastoralist and with
livestock rearing a mainstay in the economy, other sectors
have witnessed significant growth over the years. This is
especially true of the service sectors, notably in retail trade,
tourism (due to relative peace), and financial services,
with remittances playing a catalytic role in the economy.
Leveraging the significant diaspora population, remittances
continue to be the main flow of finance into the country
together with development assistance. These serve as
both a social safety net and key contributors to the growth
in various sectors, especially in construction.
The re-emergence of the Berbera Port, with investments
of US$440 million from Dubai Ports World, and its complementary
infrastructure, the Berbera Corridor, is a testimony
to the growing strategic role Somaliland could play in the
Horn of Africa, reaping a peace and stability dividend. This
is indicative of the improved investment climate in the
country, with increased opportunities for Foreign Direct
Investment (FDI) into other underdeveloped sectors such
as fisheries and commercial agriculture. The oil exploration
deal with Taiwan is another example of the improvements
to and confidence in the business environment in Somaliland.
1.2 Demographics of Somaliland
The population of Somaliland was estimated to be 3.6
million in 2014 (47.9 percent male and 52.1 percent female)
and projected to increase to 4.2 million in 2020, using a
growth rate of 2.93 percent, with the bulk of the population
living in urban centres.
The population of Somaliland has an average household
size of six with 48 percent of the population being under
the age 15 and roughly 72 percent of the population being
under 30 years. Similarly, 48 percent of the population is
within the working age group (15-64).
Somaliland’s population is young and has become more
urbanised over time due to several factors, including repeated
droughts. However, there is still a significant proportion
of Somaliland’s population living outside of urban
areas, whether living in rural settlements or as nomadic
pastoralists. Urban, rural, and nomadic households differ
significantly in terms of economic activities, sources of income,
and consumption patterns, but also in terms of public
service delivery challenges, such as the basic services of
education, health, water, and sanitation. Although poverty
is present across the country, those in non-urban areas are
more deprived.
The different population groups stand at 53 percent urban
dwellers, 11 percent residents in rural settlements, and 34
percent nomadic and agro-pastoral communities. Meanwhile,
two percent of the population lives in settlements
for Internally Displaced People (based on government and
UN estimates). Having one of the highest fertility rates in
the world, Somaliland has a broad-based age pyramid.
The population is demographically very young, with nearly
two-thirds (61 percent) of Somaliland’s population aged less
than 25 years and around three-quarters (74 percent) aged
below 30 years.
Youth between 15-29 years of age constitute 26 percent of
the population, while older persons (65 years and above)
comprise only 6 percent of the total population. Nearly half
(48 percent) of the population is within the working age (15-
64 years), highlighting the need to create jobs and ensure
that training or education address the needs of the labour
market. The sex and age distribution of the population is
presented by the population pyramid in Figure 1.
The growing urban population is already reshaping the
socio-economic dynamics in Somaliland. More individuals
in cities mean an increased demand for services and jobs.
Also, this new trend is putting pressure on prices, particularly
for food and housing.
Somaliland’s economy is based on a dichotomous employment
situation. Unemployment levels in urban Somaliland
are exceptionally high – as much as 70 percent nationally.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 4
On the one hand, there is an emerging service sector, which
is generating increasing levels of quality jobs, but which
are not adequately catered for by the local educational and
training institutions.
On the other hand, the bulk of the population is engaged
in the traditional sectors of pastoralism, agro-pastoralism,
artisan fisheries, and trade, which require minimum levels
of education and are not expected in their present situation
to lead to improved livelihoods. To the contrary, these
sectors are coming under increased threats due to the
consequences of climate change.
Diversifying the income sources of the population is a challenge
that Somaliland must face. The creation of meaningful
and adequate employment sources is a challenge every
government must tackle.

Chapter 2
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 6
2.1 Somaliland Vision 2030 and NDP
III Structure
Pillars and Sectors
In 2011, after 20 years of remarkable progress as an independent
country, Somaliland decided to embark on the
formulation of a vision that could encapsulate its long-term
aspirations. The Somaliland National Vision 2030: A Stable,
Democratic and Prosperous Country Where People
Enjoy a High Quality of Life was developed, considering
Somaliland’s past, present, and envisioned future.
Since its inception, the Somaliland National Vision 2030
has provided common goals concerning Somaliland’s
future, enabling the country to take ownership of its development
agenda. It also inspires the nation and its leadership
to mobilise resources and overcome development
challenges to attain higher standards of living. Moreover,
the vision guides development partners to align their assistance
with national priorities and aspirations. Importantly, it
provides a framework upon which national strategies and
implementation plans can be anchored.
The pillars upon which the Somaliland National Vision 2030
rests are i) Economic Development, ii) Infrastructure Development,
iii) Good Governance, iv) Social Development, and
v) Environmental Protection.
Expanding upon the five pillars of the National Vision 2030
and the NDP II, and based on requests from the affected
government institutions, the National Planning Commission
(NPC) decided to introduce changes in the planning structure
of NDP III.
Please note:
• The Judiciary Pillar was added to accommodate the
courts. The Ministry of Justice remains in the Governance
sector.
• The Social Protection sector was added to the Social
Development pillar.
Underpinning and Cross-cutting Themes
As in the NDP II, the underpinning themes of Resilience and
Human Rights are key and critical conceptual areas that
provide the foundational basis for development that each
sector rests upon.
Cutting across each of the ten sectors are the following
thematic areas:
• Displacement affected communities
• Gender
• Children’s rights
• HIV/AIDS
• People with disabilities
• Youth
2.2 Poverty and Inequality
Data on poverty and inequality dates back to the poverty
report in 2013, done in collaboration with the World Bank.
The findings suggest that poverty is more prevalent in rural
communities, where the poverty headcount stood at 37
percent. The urban areas were slightly better, with 29 percent
of the urban population considered living in poverty.
It is important to mention that significant changes occurred
between 2013 and the present, with the economy moving
away from livestock dependency to be more service-oriented.
The GDP per capita increased from an initial US$347 in
2013 to US$681 in 2022. This is likely to impact the population
in different ways, ranging from economic activities to
employment rates and household sources of income.
Based on the last labour force survey (2015), 50 percent of
the population is in the labour force, but the poverty headcount
ratio remains high among the economically active.
2.3 Social Development
Education
As in many other countries, education is highly correlated
with poverty in Somaliland, and it can be a route out of
poverty. Household heads with higher education levels are
less likely to be in poverty. Although adult literacy is close
to the Sub-Saharan Africa average, Somaliland children are
much less likely to attend primary school than children in
other countries in the region.
Children who do not attend primary education are likely
to grow up lacking basic cognitive skills. The lack of basic
cognitive skills will reduce their productivity and wages as
adults as well as reduce their ability to adapt to changes
and shocks in their environment. Children in rural areas of
Somaliland are much less likely to attend secondary school
compared to those in urban areas, raising concerns about
the disparities in education access between rural and urban
Somaliland. Cognizant of its obligation under Article 6
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states
that every child has a right to education, the government
of Somaliland has initiated various programmes over the
period of NDP II. Despite the challenges, the Gross Enrolment
Rate in primary education has improved only marginally
from 29 percent in the 2018/19 academic year to 32
percent in 2020/21. However, the Gross Enrolment Rate in
secondary education remained the same at 18 percent.
The Gender Parity Index at both primary and secondary
levels decreased from 0.84 to 0.81 and 0.78 to 0.75, respectively.
These are areas NDP III will strive to improve upon
over the next five years.
Figure 3 compares educational attainment by sex. Educational
attainment is higher for men than it is for women.
Overall, 21 percent of women have no education, compared
to 17 percent of men. Approximately 50.9 percent of women
and 42.9 percent of men in the households surveyed
have not completed primary education. Ten percent of men
attended secondary or higher schooling, compared to 9
percent of women.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 7
Health
Although there are still considerable challenges in the
health sector, noticeable progress has been registered in
many health outcomes, as per the Health and Demographic
Survey from 2020.
Maternal mortality was reduced from 732 per 100,000 live
births to 394 per 100,000 live births during the NDP II period.
It is important to note in this context that the proportion
of births attended by skilled health personnel increased
from 33 percent to 40 percent in the same period.
Between 2016 and 2021, the under-five mortality rate went
down from 137 per 1,000 live births to 91, and the infant
mortality dropped from 85 to 72 per 1000 live births. However,
neonatal mortality went up slightly, from 40 to 42
per 1,000 live births. Breastfeeding is almost universal in
Somaliland, with 94 percent of children born over the last
two years being breastfed and the prevalence of early initiation
of breastfeeding in the first hour of birth is 69 percent.
Malnutrition improved marginally from 14 percent in 2016 to
13 percent in 2021.
Also, in the context of communicable diseases, the incidence
of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected people
dropped from 6.8 to 0.03, while the incidence of tuberculosis
dropped from 285 to 200 per 100,000 people and
the incidence of hepatitis B dropped from 150 to 51 per
100,000 people.
Related to out-of-pocket expenditures, the Somaliland
Health Demographic Survey (SLHDS) reports on households'
expenditures on health services based on the last
month prior to the survey, showing that 27 percent of
households spend less than $US50, whereas 28 percent
spend US$50-99, 18 percent spend US$100-199, 7 percent
spend US$200-299, and 20 percent spend US$300 or
more on healthcare.
Water, Sanitation and Hygiene
According to the recent SLHDS, 41 percent of households
get their drinking water from improved water sources.
However, there is a slight discrepancy between the urban
and rural population, as shown in Figure 4.
This data shows that less than half of the population has
access to improved drinking water sources, defined as
piped water on premises and other drinking water sources,
like public taps or standpipes, tube wells or boreholes,
protected dug wells, protected springs, and rainwater collection.
Table 1 shows the number of additional functioning
improved drinking water sources constructed or rehabilitated
during the NDP II period.
The main interventions by the Ministry of Water Resources
Development (MoWRD) are the construction (drilling) or
rehabilitation of boreholes, together accounting for 50
percent of the 639 additional water supply systems, and
the establishment or rehabilitation of mini-water systems
(27.5 percent).
2.4 Economic Development
The Impact of Drought
In recent times, particularly beginning in 2010, there have
been repeated droughts in Somaliland due to low and erratic
rainfall. Currently, Somaliland is experiencing a drought.
The drought has led to a severe reduction in the quantity
and quality of grazing pastures and the water available
for livestock. The effect on livestock herds has been devastating.
Some regions have seen herd sizes fall by over
half due to death, distress selling, and low birth rates. As a
result, some families have lost their entire herd.
Figure 2: Changes to pillars and sectors in the NDP III planning structure
Figure 3: Education levels by sex
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 8
Around half of the population are pastoralists and livestock
play a crucial role in supporting their livelihoods. They are
a source of income and calories as well as a major capital
asset. For many pastoralists, livestock are the only asset
they own. Their living standards are intimately connected
with the health of their livestock.
Besides a damaging impact on the health of livestock herds,
the drought has had a significant direct impact on those
who are engaged in agricultural production. It has also had
an indirect impact on those working in the non-agricultural
sector through reduced economic growth and inflation.
Crop Production
Somaliland’s agriculture is dominated by subsistence
farming, mainly dependant on traditional small-scale sorghum-
based dryland agriculture (mono-cropping), although
maize is also grown, especially in years with better rainfall.
Mono-cropping has made soil less productive and is one
of the attributed factors to land degradation in traditional
farmlands. Most agriculture related programmes focus on
emergency response and resilience enhancement, with
very few working on agricultural development.
Table 2 below shows how both yields/ha and the total cultivated
area vary widely from year to year.
Livestock
Livestock exports represent about 80-90 percent of the total
value of all exported goods and services of Somaliland,
indicating their importance. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
(KSA), Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE)
are the main destinations for Somaliland livestock exports.
The bulk of the live animals being exported are small ruminants
(sheep and goats). Saudi Arabia is the main destination
for these animals, with 70 percent of the exports taking
place during the Hajj season. Based on health grounds,
Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on imports between November
2016 and May 2020, based on claims that it found Rift
Valley Fever (RVF) in Somali livestock. A second import ban
was instituted in March 2020 following the onset of the
COVID-19 pandemic and was ended in December 2022.
Figure 5 shows the export figures for sheep and goats between
2016 and 2020. The clear drop after the 2016 peak
year is explained by the combined effect of the drought
and the Saudi Arabia import ban.
Over the same period, stable numbers of live animals
were slaughtered annually for domestic consumption in
the seven urban slaughterhouses (approximately 530,000
goats and sheep, 23,000 camels, and 18,000 cattle per
year). In the domestic market, the negative impact of the
drought was compensated by the fact that more animals
were available for the domestic market due to the Saudi
Arabia import ban.
Fisheries
More than 95 percent of fish currently caught in Somaliland
are estimated to be from registered national fishing boats,
with an estimated 80 percent of this coming through the
Berbera Port. Data from other locations (Maydh, Las Khorey)
is currently not reliably collected.

Table 2: Cereal production between 2015 and 2019 (cultivated land, production, and yield)
Figure 4: Access to improved drinking water sources
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 9
International vessels can operate through a locally established
partner company and are currently (as of 2021) limited
to a maximum of four licensed vessels after a complete
ban was imposed by the Ministry of Livestock and Fishery
Development (MoLFD) in 2018 and 2019. The growth of
the annual catch from international vessels is therefore
limited. The official annual catch from international vessels
dropped from 830 tons in 2017, to zero during the period
of the imposed ban, and back to 219 tons in 2020 and 162
tons in 2021.
The limitations have been imposed for environmental reasons,
as MoLFD does not have the capacity to regularly
conduct stock assessments and establish sustainable
fishing quotas or ensure sufficient oversight to limit the
damage to coral reefs.
Figure 6 shows a steady increase of the annual catch from
registered national fishing vessels over the NDP II period,
with a total increase of 74 percent between 2016 and 2021.
The fleet of national fishing vessels that were registered
with the Fishery Department consisted in 2021 of 245
smaller vessels with an engine capacity of less than 25 hp,
123 vessels with an engine capacity between 25 hp and
100 hp, and only seven bigger vessels with an engine capacity
of more than 100 hp
Energy
The recently updated National Energy Policy estimates that
80.7 percent of Somaliland urban households have access
to electricity, whereas 20.3 percent of rural and nomadic
households have access to electricity. These figures are
slightly below the target outcome indicators of the NDP II.
Energy is relatively expensive, which has a negative impact
on household income and business development. Efforts
by the Ministry of Energy and Mining (MoEM) to reduce the
average tariff charged by energy service providers have
been a priority and during the NDP II period there has
been a reduction of 35 percent, according to a survey in
the 9 major towns, which slightly surpassed the 30 percent
target.
It is estimated that 16.2 percent of the total installed 150
MW capacity comes from renewable energy sources, considerably
above the NDP II target of 10 percent. The main
renewable energy projects implemented during the NDP II
period include:
• Energy Security and Resource Efficiency Somaliland
(ESRES) was a US$34 million clean energy investment
and technical assistance programme in Somaliland.
• The Somali Electricity Access Project (SEAP) is a
US$2.6 million clean energy investment and technical
assistance programme in Somaliland.
• Somaliland Energy Transformation was a US$4 million
renewable investment that targeted maternal
and child health facilities, schools, and water points
in the rural areas of Somaliland.
• A US$2.6 million investment in solar streetlights and
renewable energy installations for Las Anod and
Erigavo hospitals.
• The Berbera Solar Project that installed 7 MW of solar
capacity in Berbera.
In terms of improving the policy and legal framework, the
Somaliland Electrical Act was passed by the parliament
in 2018 and signed off by the president. However, there
are important sections, such as tariff regulation, that were
removed by the parliament during the review.
Upon the approval of the Act, the Somaliland Electricity
Commission was appointed, and they are currently regu-

lating the sector. The Commission is currently working to
establish the certification and licensing system of the electrical
workers and contractors. The MoEM also developed
and endorsed the temporary distribution guidelines.
In early March 2017, consultancy services were contracted
for the development of a Power Master Plan. This Power
Master Plan captures the current situation within the Somaliland
power sector as well as suggests ways to improve
efficiency. The Power Master Plan of Somaliland was
launched in 2020.
Extractives
The MoEM formulated and facilitated a multi-client 2D seismic
project, which it presented to all international oil companies
that have production sharing agreements with government.
The first project of the multi-client arrangement
was concluded in January 2018, with the acquirement of
3500 km of 2D seismic surveys for Genel Energy on blocks
SL6, SL7, SL10, and SL13. The second project was concluded
six months later in July 2018, with the acquirement of
800 km of 2D seismic surveys for RAK GAS on block SL9.
In mid-2019, both RAK Gas and Genel carried out seepage
analysis surveys. These oil and gas exploration surveys
covered 17 percent of Somaliland’s land mass, exceeding
the NPD II target of 10 percent.
The extractives sector has also implemented numerous
mineral exploration undertakings, including the following:
• Small scale jade mining
• Abdulqadir Mining exploration survey
• Dhagax Guure mining exploration survey
• Sheiklh (Sule Malable) mining exploration survey
• Laaso Surad mining exploration survey
• Exploration and small-scale mining of gold in Sanaag
• Siimoodi gemstone project.
2.5 Environmental Management
The following developments are noteworthy achievements
during the NDP II period:
Biodiversity Protection
A total of 5,000 km² of land has been gazetted as protected
areas and four biodiversity hotspot sites have been
identified and evaluated.
In terms of wildlife protection, 90 cheetahs, approximately
40 antelopes, and numerous birds of prey, wild cats, caracals,
and about 400 lizards and tortoises were saved. Three
wildlife orphanage centres have been established in Dabis,
Masalaaha, and Geeddeeble. The Ministry of Environment
and Climate Change signed an agreement with Sweden
for a project to assist in the establishment of Somaliland’s
first marine conservation area, to be established during the
NDP III period.
Soil and Water Conservation
Various soil and water conservation programmes have
been implemented, including the construction and rehabilitation
of 30 berkhads in Togdheer and 11 berkhads in
Sanaag, as well as soil bunds, stone terraces, check dams,
and gabions. Four sand dams and two earth dams were
constructed at Arabsiyo, Dabis, Aw Barkhadle, Diinqal, El
Ayfwein, and Balli Gubbedle.
Communal Grazing Reserves
Five communal grazing sites were brought under the management
of the local communities of Bancawl, Casuura,
Bookh, Aroori, and Tuuyo. An additional 20 potential communal
rangeland sites have been assessed, while dozens
of illegal private enclosures were eliminated, mainly in the
Maroodi Jeex and Togdheer regions. A rangeland demonstration
site was established at Illinta Bari.
Forestry and Tree Planting
Approximately 820,000 seedlings were distributed to major
urban centres and at least 70 percent of trees were successfully
planted. Five new tree nurseries were established
in Debis, Geeddeeble, El Afweyn, Ainaba, and Shurko and
an additional five nurseries were rehabilitated in Borama,
Berbara, Erigavo, Burao, and Hargeisa.
Reduction of the Use of Charcoal
The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, with
support from its development partners, distributed 15,000
energy-saving cooking stoves, 4,000 liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) cylinders, and 3,000 kerosene stoves covering
all regions of Somaliland.
The policy and legal instruments were put in place to introduce
a tax exemption for LPG and a tax reduction for
equipment related to alternative energy. The ministry has
also provided a subsidy for private investors interested in
producing charcoal from mesquites (Prosopis juliflora), an
invasive tree species in farmlands, especially in the west
of the country.
Key Policies and Legal Instruments
Table 3 shows the policy formulation processes in each
sector that were completed and led to approved policies
during the NDP II period.
Table 4 shows several other policy formulation processes
that led to draft versions that are available but have not yet
been submitted to or approved by the cabinet.
2.6 The Somaliland Development
Fund
The Somaliland Development Fund (SDF) is highlighted
here as an excellent example of a jointly-managed development
fund under the chairmanship of the Government
of Somaliland, leading to the successful implementation of
projects in several sectors at the value of almost US$60
million. It has been often recognised as the government’s
preferred financing mechanism.
Phase one of the SDF was successfully concluded at the
end of 2018 and phase two has been initiated. As Table 5
shows, phase one had a total of just over US$59 million in
donor contributions, used to finance 12 major projects.
In total, just under 500 procurement contracts were handled
for the supply of goods and services for the design,
preparation, implementation, and conclusion of these projects.
The vast majority (approximately 90 percent) of these
contracts were awarded to local contractors, providing a
boost to the Somaliland economy as well as reinforcing
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 11
entrepreneurial skills and routines in operating under professionally
executed contracts.
One important reason for the operational success of the
SDF projects is the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) at the
SDF Secretariat. Once an initial Project Concept Note is
approved, this will unlock financial resources for technical
assistance to support the requesting ministry in developing
a professionally designed Final Project Proposal with a
detailed budget.
Table 5 shows that just over US$50,000 was spent for
the PPF assisting the line ministries in preparing 12 projects,
with a total value of US$58.5 million, or less than 0.1
percent of the overall investments. The establishment of
a Project Preparation Facility could greatly enhance the
capacity of ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs)
to operationalise the NDP III and formulate properly designed
interventions with sound budgets. Lessons could
be learned from global funds that work with such a facility,
such as the Green Climate Fund.

MACROECONOMIC ANALYSIS
Chapter 3
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 13
3.1 Gross Domestic Product
Somaliland started measuring its annual Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2012, with technical assistance from the
World Bank, and later the Government of Sweden and the
African Development Bank (AfDB). This coincided with the
first National Development Plan (NDP I, 2012-2016). The
economy registered a steady growth from 2013 to 2016,
averaging 2.6 percent for the period under consideration
(see Figure 7).
The start of the National Development Plan II (NDP II) coincided
with negative growth, with the economy contracting
at -1.1 percent, which was mainly attributed to the drought
and restrictions imposed on livestock imports by Saudi
Arabia. The subsequent two years registered significant
growth under the circumstances, with 2.5 percent and
6.2 percent in 2018 and 2019 respectively. As Somaliland
has one of the most open economies in the region and is
connected to the world economy through trade, COVID-19
impacted the economy in 2020, as in most countries, with
a contraction of -3.1 percent.
The GDP at constant prices rose from US$1.9 billion in 2012
to US$2.3 billion in 2020, and GDP per capita (at current
prices; 2017 base year) rose from US$544 to US$697. This
highlights the significant potential for growth yet to be fully
exploited due to economic vulnerability to external related
shocks.
3.2 Sectoral Contributions to
Economic Growth
Somaliland is attempting to develop non-livestock sources
of growth for the economy to create additional revenues
for the government to invest in social sectors, as well as to
reinvest into the economy. The NDP II had strategies and
interventions in agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and the
ever-growing service sector, while identifying programmes
to promote resilience to maintain comparative advantage
in and grow the livestock sector.
Based on estimations from Somaliland’s GDP figures,
which is computed using an expenditure approach, sector
contributions to GDP in the last two years confirm the growing
importance of the service sector. Table 6 highlights the
various components based on classifications of the System
of National Accounts 2008 guidelines. The major contributions
of the three main economic sectors to GDP in 2020
were 8.1 percent from agriculture (production sector), of
which livestock clearly stands out, 18.6 percent from industry,
and 73.3 percent from services.
The Agricultural and Production Sector
The contribution of the agriculture and production sector
to GDP dropped from 8.1 percent in 2019 to 6.9 percent
in 2020. The drop is mainly attributed to the impact of
COVID-19 that curtailed livestock exports into the main
market of Saudi Arabia, as there was limited Hajj and Umrah
participation. Somaliland is the Horn of Africa’s largest
exporter of livestock - mainly goats, sheep, and cattle - into
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf States, particularly during the
Hajj. The livestock sector contributes over 75 percent of the
total value of exports, as well as to the agriculture sector.
Pastoralism continues to be the dominant economic activity
for most of the six regions across Somaliland, creating jobs
and employment for the greater part of the population.
There is limited economic activity in forestry, fisheries, and

crop production. With a coastline of over 800 kilometres,
fisheries are one of the most underdeveloped sub-sectors.
There is just one commercial fish processing factory in
the country. Despite livestock’s significant contribution to
the Somaliland economy, all three sub-sectors, including
livestock, continue to lag due to their strictly subsistence
nature.
The Industrial Sector
The contribution of the industrial sector to GDP dropped
slightly from 18.6 percent in 2019 to 15.0 percent in 2020.
All the sub-groups, i.e., construction, manufacturing, and
mining, registered drops in overall activity. The construction
industry remains the most buoyant, contributing to 93.4 percent
of industry, with both private and public investment in
the sector. The construction sub-sector is highly dependent
on remittances from Somalilanders abroad. Mining and
quarrying contributions to growth remain largely underdeveloped
whilst manufacturing is mainly in light industries.
The Services Sector
The contribution of the services sector to GDP increased
slightly from 73.3 percent in 2019 to 78.1 in 2020. All
sub-sectors showed a great deal of resilience despite the
pandemic, with just moderate drops in a few instances.
Food and beverages constitute 58.1 percent of the total
services sector, followed by other services, which include
wholesale and retail, telecoms, financial services, hospitality,
etc. Public administration remains strong, especially
from the central government, constituting 6.4 percent of
the sector, a drop from seven percent in 2019. Prospects
in the service sector depend on the rebound of activities in
accommodation, professional services, administration, remittances
(to support consumption), and hospitality, which
contracted during the pandemic due totravel restrictions.
The tourism sector could pick up as travel restrictions are
eased due to improved health responses, the administration
of COVID-19 vaccines and increased international travel.
However, the outlook for the tourism sector remains fragile
due to uncertainties surrounding the potential appearance
of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and potential need
for new travel restrictions.
3.3 Fiscal Operations
The Government of Somaliland’s fiscal position over the
last three years of NDP II was strong despite challenges
posed by COVID-19 for revenues and unexpected expenditures.
In the fiscal year 2019, the overall budget balance
(including grants) was a surplus of SlSh 90.4 billion. Due
to the pandemic, the deficit widened to SlSh 29.7 billion in
2020, attributed mainly to a reduction in grant flows as well
as increased spending on goods and services.
The budget balance was restored from a deficit to a positive
of SlSh 97.2 billion in 2021 as economic activities bounced
back. Figure 8 highlights the government’s fiscal balances
considering grants and loan repayments. The objective of
the analysis is to delineate the effect of grants and loan repayments
on current efforts to gain a strong fiscal position.
The budget balance (excluding grants) and primary balance
(excluding grants and loan repayments) were both positive
for the last three years of NDP II. The budget balance, excluding
donor funds and loan repayments, was consistently
positive, reflecting good fiscal management.
Domestic Revenue
Domestic revenue, as indicated in Figure 9, increased by
26 percent from SlSh 1.8 billion to SlSh 2.0 billion, or 7.9
percent of GDP in 2020. The revenue-GDP ratio highlights
the need for significant improvement in revenue generation,
as the World Bank’s minimum recommended ratio is
14 percent for Sub-Saharan Arica countries. Tax revenue
continued to be the main source of revenue for the gov-
Figure 8: Somaliland’s fiscal balances, 2019-2021 (SlSh)
Figure 9: Revenue composition in Somaliland (SlSh)
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 15
ernment over the NDP II period, accounting for 87.8, 86.8,
and 80.8 percent of total revenue in 2019, 2020, and 2021
respectively. The contribution of taxes to domestic revenue
is slowly reducing as non-tax revenues grow, a positive
development in expanding the revenue base.
Government Expenditures
Similarly, government expenditure grew in nominal terms
alongside revenues. Compensation of government employees
continues to be the main expenditure, with a majority
going to the security sector.
Of particular importance is the increase in project financing
from the government over the years, which grew from SlSh
27.7 billion to SlSh 182 billion, an increase of over 500 percent.
To address the infrastructure deficit, which is required
to spur economic growth, this trajectory must be sustained.
Donor funds using Somaliland’s country systems continue
to be extremely low compared against recommendations
set out in the Paris Declaration, which encouraged donors
to use country systems as opposed to creating parallel
structures.
Domestic Debt Market Developments
The domestic debt market remains shallow and is constituted
largely of arrears accumulation by Ministries, Departments,
and Agencies (MDAs). There is no accessible
capital market for the government or private sector to raise
required funding for investments. Due to a lack of access to
international financial markets and financing from multilateral
financial institutions, all of the country’s debt is domestic.
Additionally, due to an absence of financial assets such
as treasury bills and central bank bonds, all loans accrued
are mainly arrears accumulated by MDAs and central bank
advances. There is an existing debt manual that guides the
validation and payment of debt.
Total domestic debt payment as of December 2021 amounted
to SlSh 86.5 billion, dropping from a high of SlSh 111.9
billion in 2020, a 22 percent reduction (see Figure 11).
3.4 Financial Sector Development
Financial indicators of the banking industry remain within
prudential requirements, indicating a well-capitalised and
highly liquid industry.
Growth in the banking industry is evident in its asset base.
Total assets grew by 22 percent from 2019 to stand at
US$290.6 million by the end of December 2020. Overall,
the assets of the banking industry grew by 64 percent from
2017 to 2020. There was also a significant rise in bank deposits
from US$120.3 million in 2017 to US$291.1 million by
the end of 2020. This is a significant indicator of the banking
sector’s liquidity and ability to supply credit to the economy.
Although there is considerable room for improvement, the
banking sector’s catalytic role and contribution to the economy
is growing. Gross loans as of December 2020 stood
at US$184.3 million, up from US$49.7 million at the end of
2017, a growth of 271 percent. Private sector credit growth,
a universal indicator of business growth, grew 124 percent
Figure 10: Government expenditures (SlSh) Figure 11: Repayment on loans
Table 7: Financial soundness indicators of the banking sector in Somaliland
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 16
in 2020. Unfortunately, there is no data on Non-Performing
Loans (NPLs). This makes it impossible to estimate significant
asset quality measures, such as gross NPLs to gross
loans, provisions to NPLs, earning assets to total assets,
etc.
Table 7 shows that the banking industry capital adequacy
ratio averaged 12.9 percent at the end of December 2020,
compared to 13.2 percent a year ago, representing a drop
of 0.3 percentage points. Although 12.9 percent is above
the prudential requirement of 10 percent, the rate at which
it dropped since 2018 is concerning.
The industry remained highly liquid, with a liquid to total
asset ratio of over 80 percent since 2017, reaching a peak
of 90 percent at the end of December 2020. This is well
above the prudential requirement of 30 percent. This indicates
that banks are holding onto significantly more cash
than required, possibly due to the lack of safe investment
options. The ratio of liquid assets to deposits as of December
2020 was 89 percent, high enough to meet short-term
liabilities.
Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) from
the end of December 2019 to the end of December 2020
rose from 0.8 percent and 7.7 percent to 0.7 percent and
6.9 percent, respectively. The moderate returns could be
attributed to excessive liquidity, as some of the liquid assets
could be invested for higher returns.
The non-bank financial sector serves the informal component
of the economy and is often used as a good indicator
of financial inclusion. In Somaliland, non-bank financing is
provided by microfinance institutions (MFIs) and mobile
financial services. Both are expanding, in volume and in
value, contributing to the rapid expansion of the digital
financial space.
MFI’s assets, capital, and income continue to grow. Total
capital grew by 21 percent from US$5.7 million at the end of
December 2018 to US$6.8 million at the end of December
2019. MFIs registered 24 percent and 27 percent growth in
total assets and total loans, from US$7.4 million and US$6.0
million in 2018 to US$9.4 million and US4 7.5 million, respectively.
Finally, MFIs registered their highest recorded
growth rates during this period, rising from US$252,118.47
to US$ 484,867.69, an increment of 92 percent.
3.5 Balance of Payments
The balance of payment is not estimated in Somaliland
as the system of national accounts is not fully estimated.
As a result, this section analyses the goods and services
of a typical current account, depicting persistent deficits
financed through remittances and official flows. The goods
account balance is estimated to be at a deficit of US$109.8
million as of December 2021, compared to a deficit of
US$106.6 million the previous year. The deterioration in
the goods account balance mainly reflects an increase in
the importation of goods, which offsets the slight growth
in exports.

Figure 14: Exchange rate and trade balances
Source: MoPND, GDP Database
Figure 12: Goods, services, and trade account balances (in USD millions)
Source: MoPND, GDP Database
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 17
The services account balance decreased 14 percent, from
a deficit of US$16.3 million in 2019 to US$ 18.6 million in
2020. The widening deficit is attributed to a drastic drop in
both tourism and personal travel due to COVID-19.
Both the services and goods accounts persistently recorded
increasing deficits from 2017 to 2020. As a result, the
trade balance worsened over the same period, exerting
more pressure on financing the deficit. As depicted in Figure
12, the trade deficit widened from US$ -93.2 million in
2017 to US$ -128.4 in 2020, representing a negative growth
of 38 percent.
The main sources of financing the trade deficit are remittances
from abroad and Official Development Assistance
(ODA). There is limited data on Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) and Portfolio Investment Flows (PIFs) into the country.
Figure 13 compares the trade deficit with remittance flows.
3.6 Exchange Rate Development
The foreign exchange market continues to be awash with
liquidity largely due to export receipts and ODA. However,
it is equally under pressure as net flows of remittances
registered in 2021 were negative.
The Central Bank of Somaliland’s main monetary policy tool
to manage inflation is the exchange rate corridor. Based on
movements in the market, the bank embarks on open market
operations, through auctions, to stabilise the Somaliland
shilling. The bank injects more shillings into the market
when the value of the currency is considered overvalued
(appreciates) against the US dollar. Alternatively, when the
shilling depreciates, which impacts price stability, the bank
intervenes by withdrawing more shillings using the US dollar.
The market volume for US dollars then increases and
slightly depreciates against the shilling.
In Figure 14, the exchange rate (period average) depreciated
10 percent from 2017 to 2018. Subsequently, the shilling
appreciated by 14 percent in 2019 and one percent in 2020.
Overall, currency depreciation or appreciation within a five
percent band is acceptable, as it is considered non-volatile.
In this regard, the stability of the shilling from 2017-2020
bodes well for inflation and overall macroeconomic stability.
The Bank of Somaliland intervened in the market on
multiple occasions in 2021 to influence the market rate of
the shilling. Overall, the net injection was SlSh 48 billion,
indicating a strong performance of the shilling against the
US dollar.
3.7 Price Development (Inflation)
Although Somaliland is vulnerable to external shocks that
can spike inflation, such as high imports (imported inflation),
persistent trade deficits, and exchange rates, inflation
has been low and stable over the last two years. Headline
inflation has consistently been below double digits since
August 2018, when it was 13.6 percent following high
spikes in much of 2017 and 2018. Over the last two years,
prices have, to a large extent, been stable within the central
bank target of single digit inflation. Much of the inflation is
driven by food inflation, except from April 2021 to July 2021
as depicted in Figure 15. The price stability towards the end
period of NDP II is much more pronounced, as the last six
months of 2021 registered subdued prices, peaking at one
percent in July 2021.
The rise in food prices is influenced by the increase in “food
crop and related items” prices, which increased by 3.7
percent in July and 1.8 percent in August before declining
0.2 percent in September. The other volatile component of
headline inflation is energy prices, which also remained low
in the last six months, peaking in December at 2.6 percent.
As expected, core inflation is less volatile than food and
non-food inflation. This is because core inflation measures
fundamental changes in prices of goods and services in the
economy, minus the volatile items. For the last six months,
core inflation has never reached one percent. In fact, in
December 2021, it was constant at 0.5 percent from the
previous month. Indeed, the economy has experienced
price stability for the past two years, aided by central bank
monetary operations which keep inflation at reasonable
levels as COVID-19 continues to impact lives and livelihoods.

MACROECONOMIC STRATEGIES FOR GROWTH
Chapter 4
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 19
4.1 Introduction
The Somaliland economy continues to grow, riding on the
peace dividend as well as the government’s commitment
to diversify the economy away from pastoralism. Prospects
remain good in the medium and long term. The macroeconomic
framework to support growth within the period
of NDP III, in line with the objectives of Vision 2030, will
specifically include, among others, the following reforms:
• Growth diversification
• Revenue mobilisation and expenditure rationalisation
• Domestic money market development
• Improved monetary policy framework
• Financial sector stability, competitiveness, and safeguards
• Business environment improvements
• Strengthened statistics via an inter-agency macroeconomic
working group
4.2 Fiscal Policy
Domestic revenue (tax and non-tax) mobilisation is imperative
to generate additional revenue and achieve greater
budgetary flexibility, especially on development and project
financing. The fiscal envelope will be expanded to increase
expenditures on social services and infrastructure development.
Options include improving revenue collection
and streamlining expenditures to more strategic issues.
Although sensitive for a low-income country, taxation will
be fair and non-distortionary, forming the bedrock of sustainable
revenue mobilisation.
Revenue Mobilisation
Independent and semi-autonomous revenue authorities
have proven to be effective in improving compliance in
many areas. As a result, the Somaliland Revenue Authority
will be established. Tax exemptions will be streamlined for
both inland revenue and customs. The exemption rules and
procedures will be strict. There will also be improved tax
exemption reporting for inland revenue as part of annual
tax returns and partner funds will be incorporated into the
budget.
For inland revenue:
• The revenue base will be expanded by encouraging
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) into
formal structures and/or improving overall compliance
in the informal sector.
• The Integrated Tax Administration System (ITAS) in
the Public Financial Management (PFM) reform strategy
will be prioritised in phase II of the World Bank
project, replacing the PFM Support project. The automation
will improve general taxpayer information
and, eventually, compliance.
• The capital gains tax will be reformed so taxes will be
paid after disposal. It is beneficial to have a specific
tax on the sale value or a percentage of the consideration
made, whichever is higher. Presently, any gain
or loss from the disposal of an asset is included in
gross income or the loss is permitted as a deduction
of gross income. This is prone to non-compliance.
• Telecoms taxation will be improved by introducing an
excise on telecoms, a Global System for Mobile Communication
(GSM) tax on all calls, and the standard
corporate tax on profits payable by GSM companies.
This will be followed by telecoms audits, possibly
with external technical assistance.
In the context of customs revenue:
• In line with the PFM Strategy, the customs department
will receive funding to transition to the Automated
System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) system, which
will reduce most of the current manual valuation.
• Utilising the Berbera Oil Terminal, and the overall
Barbera Corridor, the government will continue to
devise strategies to increase imports from Ethiopia,
including fuel.
• The taxation regime on khat, cigarettes, and other
tobacco products will be overhauled based on World
Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations. There
will be an ad valorem tax and a specific tax on all
tobacco products.
Rationalised Expenditures
With limited domestic resources, the government will rationalise
expenditures to be efficient and effective, reducing
waste and improving impact.
DRIVERS OF GROWTH IN SOMALILAND
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 20
In line with the PFM Strategy, the government will work on
the establishment of the Procurement Authority, working
closely with the National Tender Board (NTB) and parliament.
This will pave the way to decentralise procurement
in government, improving capacity at the MDA level and
increasing value for money.
Linking the budgeting process to the National Development
Plan will address the mismatch between the annual
budgets and the NDP III. Additionally, extrabudgetary expenditures
will be reduced to keep arrears at sustainable
level by MDAs.
4.3 Monetary Sector Developments
Currently, the only monetary policy tool utilised by the
Central Bank is the exchange rate corridor. This requires
building foreign exchange buffers as part of the reserve
management. There are downside risks to the effectiveness
of this strategy, particularly the vulnerability of livestock
exports, volatile inflow of remittances, and reduced ODA.
In the near future, the Central Bank intends to adopt a
monetary targeting regime using Narrow Money (M1) and
Broad Money (M2). It will consider reserve requirements as
one of its morphing strategies. A well-capacitated research
department, rather than a monetary policy unit, will be established
to help the bank’s continuous assessment of the
economy to prescribe the right policies for price stability,
financial sector management, and economic growth.
On financial inclusion, a credit information system will be
established to reduce possible excessive credit concentration
and work on creating a platform for guarantees for
SMEs. Presently, Somaliland’s banks have too much liquidity.
Therefore, financial sector policies to incentivise lending
to the private sector will be promoted. This will create a
win-win situation, where liquidity could increase yields for
banks while providing needed credit to the private sector.
4.4 Financial Stability and
Safeguards
The banking sector is in good condition, but financial
inclusion remains limited despite recent gains, especially
among women in the informal economy. The sector is dominated
by a few large players, organised in an oligopolistic
structure, with limited information provided to the Central
Bank on important indicators that gauge asset qualities,
such as on Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). The Central
Bank will continue to build its supervisory capacity, utilising
standard reporting tools for all bank and non-bank financial
institutions. There is a need to improve data sharing
obligations so that banks and non-banks regularly supply
information to the Central Bank, especially on credit distribution.
This information will help the government avoid
credit concentration and develop incentives to stimulate
borrowing in critical sectors of the economy. Besides the
building of a credit information system to reduce possible
excessive credit concentration and improve inclusion,
a platform for guarantees for MSMEs must be created to
enhance inclusion.
Regulations and the payment architecture for mobile banking
need to be improved. Mobile banking services have
the potential to improve financial inclusion via an electronic
payment platform in the country.
Risk-based bank supervision and the enforcement of
prudential ratios must be introduced based on the Basel
Committee recommendations. The whole range of financial
sector indicators will be subjected to prudential requirements.
4.5 Domestic Currency and the
Debt Market
The government of Somaliland, through the Central Bank,
will work on modalities to introduce money markets into
the country in line with the principles of Islamic banking, as
required by the Islamic Banking Act.
Due to limited domestic resources, much of Somaliland’s
development budget comes from international partners.
Domestic revenue is mainly comprised of taxes, especially
on international trade. The government doesn’t have access
to multilateral financial institutions, hence the need to
create an avenue to raise funds both from domestic economic
players and Somaliland’s diaspora. This will serve
both the government and corporate sectors, as there is
a need for a domestic money market to raise capital for
investments.
For the establishment of a domestic debt market, strictly
based on Shariah-compliant investments, the government
will study the model in other Islamic countries and Sukuk
markets and adjust for local context. Furthermore, a national
development forum on domestic market development
will be organised, including discussions on establishing
diaspora bonds, a financial tool available in other countries
in the region.
Prior to the establishment of the money market, a debt
law must be enacted. The law can legislate the “golden
rule principle”, taking debt only for capital expenditures.
Moreover, it can introduce an explicit debt anchor by, for
example, targeting a specific debt-to-GDP ratio. A debt
management strategy will then be developed based on the
proposed legislation, based on the objectives of contracting
debt at the lowest cost and risk to future generations.
4.6 Improving the Business
Environment
The business environment in Somaliland remains good,
but improvements will further support private sector-led
growth. The World Bank’s 2012 Doing Business Index (DBI)
ranked Hargeisa 174 out of 183 in doing business. Since
then, there was no other DBI report that included Somaliland.
Recently, the Ministry of Finance Development conducted
a study of the business environment in the county,
based on the recommendations in the 2012 DBI report.
This study concluded that:
Momentum needs to be sustained in the following areas:
• The number of days it takes to register a business
has been reduced and Somaliland is now competitive
among East African countries. Only Rwanda is
doing better, with just 4 days.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 21
• Continue the one-stop shop for investors.
Improvements are needed in the following areas:
• Improvements in the energy sector will be geared
towards reducing costs, establishing a national grid,
improving the energy mix for sustainability, strengthening
regulations, and enhancing standardisation.
• Access to credit remains a challenge - out of the
eleven indicators in the 2012 DBI report, access to
credit was ranked the lowest. The policies mentioned
previously under the financial sector are expected to
improve this indicator.
• Although competitive in the region, paying taxes will
be made more efficient for the taxpayer and less
costly for the government to collect, especially for
land and buildings. There will be an inter-agency
committee to review reforms and create a roadmap
on how to address reforms, if needed.
• Land banking for investment will be prioritised based
on the recently approved Land Policy in 2021, which
establishes reforms to the land tenure system.
Overall, these strategies are anticipated to address the
maroeconomic risk summarized in Table 8.
Table 8: Macroeconomic risk assessment matrix
MAINSTREAMING CLIMATE CHANGE IN NDP III IMPLEMENTATION
Chapter 5
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 23
5.1 Introduction
Somaliland is highly vulnerable to the risks of climate
change and extreme weather conditions. The NDP III
comes at a time when Somaliland has experienced five
consecutive failed rainy seasons, and forecasts indicate
that the rainfall in 2023 will be below the average, devastatingly
impacting the ecosystem. These droughts and
shocks are increasingly becoming recurrent and disproportionally
affecting vulnerable groups, including women
and girls, children, the elderly, people with disabilities, and
other marginalized groups. Frequent and intense droughts
undermine food security and worsen livelihood conditions,
fuelling societal grievances, increasing competition over
scarce resources, and exacerbating existing community
tensions and vulnerabilities. Climate change has complex
and interlinked implications for natural resources, peace
and security, human health, migration and displacement,
gender equality, and vulnerable and marginalized groups.
Hence, the NDP III is adopting a climate resilience approach
in its implementation by mainstreaming climate change mitigation
and adaptation strategies to respond to the needs
and priorities of different communities.
Compared to other nations, Somaliland emits relatively low
levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere but
suffers from the impact of global greenhouse gas emissions.
In the NDP III, Somaliland is committed to reducing
the emission of greenhouse gases by increasing the share
of renewable energy sources and generation and planting
trees in urban and rural areas.
5.2 Climate Change Adaptation
Approaches
The NDP III will embed climate change adaptation approaches
in its implementation to combat the climate crisis
and achieve Somaliland’s national development priorities.
Climate-resilient Infrastructure
Somaliland aims to build advanced infrastructure that enables
economic and social development while facilitating
local, regional, and global trade. The priority is a domestic
road network that connects the different parts of the country.
37.71 percent of the cost of the NDP III is dedicated to
building to climate-resilient infrastructure such as roads,
bridges, ports, airports, and telecommunication lines that
can withstand shocks from extreme climate impacts. Investing
in resilient infrastructure is a key strategy for adapting
to climate change and will save billions of dollars worth
of damages while reducing vulnerabilities. More resilient
infrastructure assets pay for themselves with extended
lifecycles and more reliable services.
Early Warning Systems
Somaliland relies on regional institutions for climate information
and early warning systems. Although the Ministry of
Agriculture Development (MoAD) keeps weather records
at specific meteorological stations across the country
and NADFOR disseminates periodic weather information
through radio, rural communities seldom access this information
to take necessary actions. Historically, rural communities
have relied on natural indicators like wind direction,
the location of stars in the sky, and cloud movements to
predict the weather. However, these typical climate patterns
no longer exist or are more difficult to predict because of
climate change. Early warning systems are becoming a
critical adaptation measure that can reduce the damage
of droughts to the economy, specifically for agro-pastoralists
and vulnerable groups. In the NDP III implementation,
the Government of Somaliland will establish the National
Meteorological Agency (NMA) for the documentation and
timely dissemination of climate information to stakeholders
to prepare for eminent droughts and other climate patterns.
Water Supply and Security
Recurrent droughts from declining rainfall have significantly
reduced the availability of water in Somaliland. Water
scarcity kills livestock, dries crops, and forces pastoralists
and agro-pastoralists to move from one place to another in
search of water and pasture. In urban areas, families prioritise
water for cooking and drinking and forgo bathing and
washing clothes during dry seasons when water is scarce
and expensive. In its implementation, the NDP III invests in
rainwater harvesting systems to increase water availability.
These measures will be complemented by the installation
of green technology, such as solar water sources, to improve
water supply sustainability and reduce the cost of
operations and maintenance. It is also vital to adopt a policy
of Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM), which
considers the entire water cycle from source and distribution
to treatment, reuse, and return to the environment in a
sustainable manner
Natural Landscape Restoration and
Reforestation
Over the past two decades, the degradation of natural
resources and deforestation, mainly driven by charcoal
production and overgrazing, have rapidly increased Somaliland’s
vulnerability to climate change-induced droughts
and desertification. The Environment chapter of the NDP
III outlines nature-based solutions or ecosystem-based
adaptations for the climate crisis. This includes planting
trees in urban and rural areas and on mountain slopes and
planting mangroves in coastal areas to significantly reduce
heatwaves, provide natural sea defences from storm surges,
and prevent desertification.
Sustainable Production Practices
In Somaliland, most food production depends on weather
conditions as a majority of the country’s agriculture is rainfed.
Changing rainfall patterns make it difficult for farmers
to determine when to sow the seeds, which can lead to
reduced food production and availability. For example,
farmers typically sow their fields in February each year
and expect rainfall between March and May, while finally
harvesting in July or August. However, infrequent rain and
shifting rainfall patterns lead to smaller yields or, in some
cases, total crop failure for the year. The Production chapter
of the NDP III outlines the implementation of sustainable agricultural
practices to achieve food through strengthening
communities’ resilience and adaptive capacity, while also
protecting marine resources and adopting climate-resilient
livestock management approaches.
Considerations for Vulnerable Groups
The NDP III reflects the needs and priorities of the vulnerable
group in the Cross-cutting Themes chapter while
also being inclusive in its implementation. Implementing
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 24
the NDP III strengthens vulnerable groups' resilience and
reduces their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related
events and shocks. For example, the implementation
of national social protection systems and measures for
vulnerable groups, including women and children, people
with disabilities, displacement affected communities, and
people living with HIV/AIDS, will strengthen resilience and
adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural
disasters. Moreover, ensuring that vulnerable groups have
equal rights to economic resources, access to basic services,
and ownership and control over productive resources
will further insulate them from climate-related crises.
Long-term Planning
The NDP III envisages climate adaptation solutions that
could be more effective if integrated into national development
policies, strategies, and plans. Somaliland will develop
a National Adaptation Plan (NAP) which will consolidate and
harmonize strategies, plans, and policies to strategically
prioritize adaptation needs to address climate change-related
crises. The NAP will inform government decisions on
investments and regulatory and fiscal framework changes
and raise public awareness of climate change risks. Given
the unique case of Somaliland, the government will work
with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to explore
ways to support the development of the NAP, which will
also be used to improve adaptation elements for Nationally
Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are a central part
of the Paris Agreement.
5.3 Financing Climate Change
Mitigation and Adaptation
Somaliland is committed to upholding the UN Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other international
treaties in tackling the risks of climate change.
Although Somaliland cannot directly participate in global
climate change discussions as a state, it can still participate
and play an active role through the UN, regional bodies,
friendly states, and other multilateral agencies. For example,
in collaboration with the UN Development Programme
(UNDP), the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change
(MoECC) organizes annual climate change forums where
participants exchange updates about the impacts of climate
change and adaptation strategies. The MoECC will
expand these forums by inviting all relevant public and
private institutions, development partners, and think tanks
and research firms. The MoECC will also organize regional
events to cascade climate change discussions to affected
communities and their governance structures. Furthermore,
the MoECC will coordinate with relevant stakeholders, such
as UNEP, to formulate the NAP that will guide the national
adaptation needs.
Like many other developing countries, Somaliland needs to
finance its climate change mitigation and adaptation measures.
There are several global funds available for climate
change mitigation and adaptation. While Somaliland may
not be able to benefit directly from these funds as a state,
it can still access financing through the UN, specifically
UNEP, and other multilateral agencies.
These funds include:
• The Global EbA Fund provides grants to innovative
approaches to ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA).
• The Adaptation Fund Climate Innovation Accelerator
(AFCIA).
• The Green Climate Fund (GCF).
• Strengthening Endogenous Capacities of Least
Developed Countries to Access Finance for Climate
Change Adaptation (UNI-LEAD) and others.
Moreover, the announcement of a global Loss and Damage
Fund at the most recent United Nations Climate Conference
(COP27) is an opportunity for Somaliland and other
developing countries to finance their climate mitigation and
adaptation needs. Since Somaliland is likely to face restrictions
and challenges in accessing climate change adaptation
and mitigation financing, the country needs to develop
an innovative strategy to coordinate with UN agencies and
other multilateral agencies to benefit from available funds.

Somaliland’s Vision 2030, with respect to the state of the
economy, is to be “a nation whose citizens enjoy sustained
economic growth and reduced poverty levels”. To achieve
this objective, the government will prioritise expenditures
on core sectors such as health, education, and water. The
emphasis will be on improving human capital as a bedrock
of development. Furthermore, development will always be
anchored on sound macroeconomic policies and enabling
factors, such as trade facilitation and investment policies,
which will lead to job creation and ultimately improve livelihoods
through increased incomes.
The anchor of the Somaliland economy used to be livestock
and livestock-related activities, but over the years
this has shifted, at least in terms of market value, to the
service industry. This is a common trajectory of economies
in Sub-Saharan Africa - skipping growth in industrialisation
and instead focusing on services.
In the services subsector, the dominant players are retail
trade, telecoms, tourism, and financial services. Remittances
play a catalytic role in the economy and are supported
by the large diaspora population. Remittances and the
export of livestock ensure a steady supply of much-needed
foreign currency to finance the persistent account deficit.
The economy is growing as an important logistics hub for
the Horn of Africa, riding on the Berbera Corridor and the
peace dividend. The successful Dubai Ports World investment
in the Berbera Port and a logistic hub by trading giant
Trafigura are good indications of the investment climate in
the country. Investments in fish processing from artisanal
fishing can be an important source of value added in the
economy.
Notwithstanding these gains, Somaliland’s economy
remains vulnerable to shocks. To grow on a sustainable
path, a reform agenda should be pursued to improve the
enabling business environment. A key component of this is
expanding the financial sector to support economic growth,
which will be complemented by public sector reforms.
6.2 Situational Analysis
The NDP II period witnessed successes and challenges
regarding the economy. Although external factors continue
to hinder the growth of the economy, challenges also
remain on the domestic front. This section highlights the
progress as well as the challenges in this sector.
Policies and Legal Reforms
The government’s role in a typical liberal economy is to create
an enabling environment through appropriate policies
and legal instruments for the private sector to prosper, as
well as to address market failures and the provision of public
goods. The policies and laws in Table 9 were approved
during the implementation of NDP II.

government to continually improve the business environment
for improved inclusive economic growth.
Public Financial Management
Public Financial Management (PFM) was driven by its reform
strategy, which has several important reform programmes,
i.e., in the budgeting process, increasing domestic revenue,
automating the country’s payment system, and building the
capacity of public services to better manage the country’s
finances.
The Ministry of Planning and National Development led a
prioritisation process of Somaliland’s NDP II (2017-2021),
and subsequent budget cycles were informed by these
outcomes. The Ministry of Finance Development has also
engaged with communities and held public hearings on the
budgetary process to enhance citizen engagement and
accountability. One of the PFM targets included improving
human capital, IT infrastructure, and automation, as well as
legal and regulatory frameworks. This has been partially
achieved, as mentioned in the policies and reforms subsection.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 27
There has been a strong focus on improvements to the
inland revenue system. As a result, the government has
updated its tax policy – which aims to broaden the tax
base – and has introduced progressive and fair taxes,
modernised tariffs, and has improved overall efficiencies in
the tax system.
In line with the PFM Strategy, the government has reviewed
its fiscal transfer provisions, particularly concerning local
governments, which has led to improvements in this area.
The Somaliland Financial Management Information System
(SLFMIS) has been operational since 2017. The system has
had significant positive impacts on government public financial
management, including improvements in the accuracy
and efficiency of processing transactions and reporting,
more efficient domestic revenue collection and reporting,
improved budget discipline for government spending, and
enhanced transparency and accountability in the collection
and utilisation of public funds.
The SLFMIS has enabled the government to align budget
classifications with international standards, such as the
Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG),
as well as the development of charts of accounts that are
compliant with the International Monetary Fund Government
Financial Statistics (IMF-GFS) guidelines.
On budget transparency and accountability, the government
has been actively engaging the public, especially
civil society. The Ministry of Finance Development has
published all budgets since 2017, the Ministry’s Strategic
Plan 2019-2023, and annual fiscal reports, as well as key
statistics, such as on annual trade. Importantly, a citizens'
budget has also been prepared and disseminated.
Finance and Banking
The Central Bank of Somaliland regulates the country’s
finances, with a key mandate to ensure price stability with a
target of inflation of, at most, 10 percent. This goal has been
achieved despite global economic shocks.
Key steps taken include managing the fluctuations in the
exchange market as well as building the capacity and raising
awareness of financial institutions to pending policies,
laws, and regulations.
As Somaliland is a dollarised economy, there must be a sufficient
supply of foreign currency in the market. The Central
Bank intervenes in the market to stabilise the exchange
rate to avoid volatility passing onto prices.
On banking regulations and licensing, the Central Bank has
streamlined the registration and licensing of all financial
institutions operating in Somaliland. A total of six banks are
currently in operation. A banking association was established
to increase collaboration on financial intermediation
and interbank activities in all areas of operations, including
financing and credit references. The Central Bank has also
developed the 2022 Clearing House Regulation.
Four non-banking financial service providers were licensed
between 2018-2021. There were only two licensed mobile
money service providers before 2017. However, in 2019, a
new entrant was granted a license by the Central Bank.
The Central Bank granted licenses to over 1,200 foreign exchange
dealers between 2017 and 2021. It also took a bold
step towards organising foreign exchange traders through
support from mobile money service providers.
Insurance
The Insurance Authority was established in 2021 and is
mandated to regulate and supervise the growing number
of insurance companies in Somaliland that were previously
regulated by the Central Bank. While the insurance industry
is still in its infancy stage, there are now nine licensed insurance
companies in Somaliland.
The Gross Premium in the emerging insurance subsector
increased from US$1 million to US$1.7 million in 2021. Major
business portfolios included the medical, marine, and motor
industries, amounting to 99 percent of the total gross
premiums written within the insurance industry in Somaliland
in 2021.

Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises
Micros, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a
key role in inclusive growth and employment. In Somaliland,
MSMEs are enterprises that employ less than 100
people and have sales turnover or total assets of less than
US$500,000.
MSMEs contributed significantly to the post-war recovery
in Somaliland following independence and remain a core
element of the country’s private sector-driven economy.
A 2017 study by Cardiff University and Gollis University
showed that most enterprises in Somaliland are informal
and involved in trade. The study estimated that in Hargeisa
alone, the informal economy provides 77 percent of the
city’s total employment. To facilitate the ease of doing business,
the Ministry of Trade and Tourism has established a
Business Information Centre (BIC), or Xogsiiye-9444, aimed
at providing information to small businesses. The BIC provides
information across Somaliland in Somali, English, and
Arabic on business start-up practices, access to finance,
and business development services.
Following the approval of the MSME Policy 2019, the ministry
drafted a roadmap for implementation and established a
technical working group to guide the process.
The Ministry of Trade and Tourism established a business
licensing inspection team that has been undertaking
inspection activities since 2018 to ensure that all types of
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 28
businesses operating in the country legally exist and are
registered. This measure aims to reduce the growing number
of unregistered and unlicensed enterprises.
The one-stop shop platform for business registration and
licensing was established in 2021, which aims to ease the
process of registering businesses by both national and
international investors. This will help streamline and automate
business registration as well as increase certainty and
transparency in setting up businesses, which will increase
investor confidence.
The government extended COVID-19 support to businesses
in 2020 by cutting the cost of registering a business in
Somaliland by both citizens and foreign nationals by 50
percent. In addition, 20 start-ups were granted a 65 percent
reduction on business registration and licensing fees.
Tourism
On tourism, the government undertook certain measures
primarily linked to the protection and preservation of historical
and archaeological sites in Somaliland. Sites that have
been protected include Laas Geel, Dhagah Kuurre, Abbasa,
Qiblatayn, Dhagah Nabi Galay, and Old Amoud, among
others. These measures are geared towards contributing
to their long-term preservation, especially the Laas Geel
heritage site, which is being promoted as a tourist attraction
so it can to be better integrated into the local economy.
Trade and Investment
The Investment Policy 2019 and the Investment Act (Law
No. 99/2021) introduced measures to promote, strengthen,
and streamline foreign and domestic investment in Somaliland,
as well as improvements to productivity and competitiveness.
The Berbera Corridor is considered a strategic
trade and transit route for the Horn of Africa and beyond.
To leverage this opportunity, the Government of Somaliland
established the Berbera Special Economic Zone (SEZ),
which extends 12 km from the Port of Berbera, to be the
leading integrated maritime, logistics, and industrial hub in
the Horn of Africa. The Somaliland Special Economic Zones
Law 93/2021 was passed in 2021 and aims to provide local
and foreign investors with a conducive and competitive
environment for investment and trade.
The SEZ’s one-stop shop will be managed by Dubai Ports
World and provide a range of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.
These include exemption from corporate taxes,
duty-free storage of goods and 100 percent foreign ownership,
as well as the ability to operate through branches of
foreign companies.
Complementary investments by partners to build the road
leading to Ethiopia and the Hargeisa bypass, as well as
other investments at the border town of Tog-Wajaale, were
all geared towards leveraging the Berbera Port. Dubai
Ports World and the Ethiopian Ministry of Transport signed
a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2022 with the
aim of developing the Ethiopian side of the road, linking
Addis Ababa to Berbera, with the goal of establishing a
major trade and logistics corridor in the region.
Labour and Employment
The key labour focus during NDP II was promoting employment-
related programmes that target youth and women.
Several successful programmes were implemented with a
focus on youth entrepreneurship and creating jobs. Most
of these programmes are implemented by international
non-governmental organisations (INGOs).
The government initiated the National Service Programme
(NSP) in 2018, aimed to foster youth employment and create
a platform that provides internships to young professionals.
In September 2022, the Civil Service Commission
announced the placement of 482 NSP trainees (171 women
and 311 men) as full-time government employees in all six
regions of the country. This was the third batch of NSP
trainees given job placements since the programme was
launched by the president in 2018.
In 2018, the Labour Act was amended and the first guidelines
for work permits for foreign workers were developed.
Furthermore, an online system for work permits has been
established and made operational. A labour union was
established to promote and strengthen social dialogue.
6.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
• With limited funding - attributed to the international
status of the country - fiscal sustainability is a key
challenge. Domestic resources alone are not sufficient
for major capital investments and the prioritisation
of funding for critical social sectors remains a
concern.
• Human resources and technical capacity needed to
support institutions in the economy remain limited.
Additionally, the effective utilisation of external financial
and technical assistance remains a challenge.
• The economy is minimally diversified, depending
mostly on imports of goods from abroad, making
it vulnerable to external shocks such as conflicts,
pandemics, and supply chain disruptions. Due to
the structure of the economy, domestic revenue is
dependent more on customs (77 percent) than inland
revenue.
• There is a low uptake of insurance products due
to low levels of awareness. Additionally, insurance
authorities lack the capacity to support a conducive
environment for insurance service providers or educate
the public about the benefits of using insurance
services. For a modern economy with risk and uncertainty,
this limits possible international investments.
• Access to finance is one of the key challenges facing
the private sector, especially for MSMEs, and could
hinder attracting investment in key sectors. This is
related, to some extent, to the state of the financial
sector. Modern capital market structures that align
with Islamic principles, such as Sukuk markets, are
limited. There are also no commercial banking laws
in Somaliland.
• Somaliland must strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness
of the regulatory framework for MSMEs to
address business environment constraints.
• MSMEs with high potential for job creation must be
more effectively supported, especially priority sectors
where value chains are limited.

6.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: To promote a sound and stable
macroeconomic environment.
Outcome 1: By 2026, Somaliland will achieve inclusive
and sustainable economic growth through sound
macroeconomic frameworks and policies.
The Ministry of Finance will achieve this outcome through
the following priority interventions:
1. Establishing policy and administrative reforms to
strengthen compliance and improve domestic revenue
mobilisation. On domestic revenue generation,
as the country has a large informal sector, this means
expanding the tax base to include MSMEs by further
encouraging their integration into the formal economy.
Key reforms may include increased automation
of tax collection through a more integrated structure,
such as the widely used Integrated Tax Administration
System (ITAS). This includes the adoption of
ASYCUDA World software and systems for customs
operations.
2. Stringently enforcing a tax exemption regime for both
international trade and inland revenue. Particular emphasis
will be placed on domestic taxes, as current
tax expenditures are only monitored for revenue loss
on international trade.
3. Exploring different financing schemes due to limited
access to development financing from multilateral
development banks. This includes climate financing,
blended financing, diaspora bonds, and Islamic capital
markets.
4. Continuing to realign the budget and prioritising expenditures
for growth-enhancing sectors, as well as
the provision of social services. Priority will be given
to education, health, livestock and fisheries, environmental
management, food security, the digital
economy, and growth-inducing expenditures in the
areas of oil and gas, infrastructure, trade facilitation,
and soft infrastructure, among others.
5. Ensuring that the Budget Committee, chaired by the
minister of planning, allocates resources in line with
national development goals, barring any emergency
circumstances.
6. Strengthening the democratic gains of the country
and upholding budget transparency. The national
budget, monthly budget reports, and the citizens’
budget will be made widely available to the public.
It is envisaged this will generate a feedback mechanism
for future consultations with the public.
Furthermore, the Central Bank of Somaliland will prioritise
the following interventions:
1. Maintaining domestic monetary policy for price stability.
The ultimate objective for all Central Banks is
price stability, and the Somaliland Central Bank is no
exception. The bank will continue to pursue policies
geared towards expanding the toolkit at its disposal
to fight inflation. Currently, the only mechanism is
exchange rate market intervention. A broad-based
approach, including targeting monetary aggregates,
will be established.
Outcome 2: By 2027, Somaliland will have
strengthened the capacity of domestic financial
institutions to encourage and expand access to
banking, insurance, and financial services for all.
The Central Bank of Somaliland will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Improving financial intermediation in the economy,
especially interbank transactions for overnight lending.
Currently, financial penetration through banks
remains low, especially for MSMEs and women-led
businesses. Additionally, there are virtually no interbank
transactions in Somaliland, which is an issue
that must be remedied in collaboration with the
Bankers’ Association. Relatedly, developing subregional
banking links with Ethiopia will be prioritised
to ease trade financing and support transit trade with
Ethiopia.
2. Undertaking financial sector reforms, including
expanding money markets based on Islamic Sukuk
principles as used in other countries.
3. Regulating the financial sector in line with market-
based principles. This will be the foundation on
which a national payment system for the country will
improve interbank connectivity.
4. Developing innovative financial products to support
growth. This is especially important for financial inclusion,
especially for MSMEs and women.
Furthermore, the National Insurance Authority will achieve
this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Developing the insurance industry to help mitigate
risks for businesses and consumers. This ensures
that slight shocks, disasters, and vulnerabilities have
a limited impact on businesses and individuals.
2. Enhancing the oversight and supervision of the insurance
industry. The regulatory environment will be
strengthened to protect all policyholders and beneficiaries.
The speed at which claims are addressed
will be crucial to building confidence in the industry.
This will promote the maintenance of a fair, safe, and
stable insurance industry.
3. Increasing insurance uptake. There will be more
advocacy programmes to increase awareness of and
education on the strategic role insurance can play in
the economy.
Strategic Objective 2: To facilitate a conducive environment
for investment and private sector development, whilst
promoting decent work conditions and labour productivity.
Outcome 3: By 2027, Somaliland will have
strengthened institutions and regulatory frameworks
through the development and promotion of
development-oriented policies and acts that support
productive activities, entrepreneurship, decent job
creation, creativity, and innovation.
The Ministry of Trade and Tourism will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Strengthening the legal frameworks that support the
business environment, private sector, and production
sector, such as frankincense production and tourism,
to foster their development.
2. Improving the enabling environment for businesses
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 30
through a private sector development programme
that:
• Fosters the formalisation of informal businesses
• Provides adequate fiscal incentives in line with
existing fiscal policies
• Promotes Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
and enables better access to commercial justice
for MSMEs
• Enables the simplification of regulatory processes
for business registration and licensing to
lower transaction costs, and improve timeliness
Outcome 4: By 2027, Somaliland will have expanded
its programmes and policies that promote
sustainable tourism to create jobs and promote
Somaliland’s local culture and products.
The Ministry of Trade and Tourism will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Conserving and restoring archaeological sites, which
are currently the main tourism assets for the country.
2. Developing more culture-based tourism products,
leveraging the wider Somali culture spread through
the diaspora population.
3. Supporting the design of more tourism products.
4. Formulating and implementing tourism-friendly legislation.
5. Implementing research-backed marketing through
activities such as strengthening data, research, and
statistics and improving tourism movement facilitation
(visas, movement facilitation forms, etc.).
6. Developing marketing strategies based on:
• Attending travel and tourist fairs such as World
Travel Market (London, UK), Vakantiebeurs
(Utrecht, Netherlands), Fitur (Madrid, Spain),
and ITB (Berlin, Germany)
• Using social media to promote the destination
of Somaliland
• Conducting joint marketing with airlines already
operating in the country
• Establishing an agency for destination marketing,
similar to other African countries
Outcome 5: By 2027, Somaliland will have diversified
its economy through improved trade facilitation and
economic cooperation.
The Ministry of Trade and Tourism will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Developing a Somaliland trade policy that will provide
an evidence-based strategic direction for export
promotion, import substitution, value-addition, and
the overall trade balance. This will be aligned with
the Industrial Policy and the Tariff Policy to assess the
potential impacts of targeting specific markets and
sectors. This will contain specific targets for exports,
imports, and value-additions.
2. Deepening economic integration through bilateral
MOUs, especially in the subregion. These platforms
will facilitate partnerships between Somaliland
traders and their partners, especially the MSMEs,
which could be used to improve the livelihoods of
cross-border communities.
3. Eliminating tariff and non-tariff barriers to regional
trade routes. These will complement the gains made
from infrastructure development along the Berbera
Corridor.
4. Designing and implementing capacity-building programmes
for MSMEs, ranging from entrepreneurship
skills and bookkeeping to improving e-commerce
skills, with the goal of equipping MSMEs with skills to
conduct online business.
5. Formulating intellectual property law and commercial
codes to encourage innovation and protect budding
entrepreneurs. This will also encourage more foreign
investment and business activity, as the enforcement
of contracts is an integral component of business
confidence indicators.
6. Creating platforms to increase the access of information
to traders through various mechanisms such as
trade fairs, business-to-business meetings, and the
use of trade magazines and brochures for publicity.
The Somaliland SEZ Authority will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Strengthening the legal framework, governance
structures, management systems, and human capabilities
of the authority to attain higher productivity.
2. Creating 1,200 employment opportunities in five
years through the SEZ scheme.
3. Establishing a collaboration mechanism with key
stakeholders (public institutions and the private sector)
to foster the functionality of the SEZ.
4. Boosting trade facilitation through an efficient SEZ
by:
• Offering fiscal incentives for all operators in the
SEZ
• Attracting FDI by relaxing restrictions in the SEZ
and in Somaliland in general
• Improving government processes, such as customs
clearance for goods and other re-export
products
• Developing infrastructure for the SEZ
Outcome 6: By 2027, Somaliland will have adopted
Investment and industrial development regimes to
promote sustainable development.
The Ministry of Investment and Industrial Development will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Creating and strengthening the enabling environment
for investment in Somaliland, based on investment
policy guidelines. This includes one-stop shops
for investors to improve the clarity and speed of
government procedures. Furthermore, The Ministry
will strengthen the collaboration amongst national
institutions related to investment facilitation
2. Developing a sound and comprehensive industrial
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 31
sector policy and strategy, and aligning harmonised
procedures, regulations, and guidelines.
3. Developing and establishing Industrial Zones for all
regions in Somaliland.
4. Prioritising the Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) policy
and legal frameworks to encourage PPP projects,
especially in infrastructure.
5. Attracting foreign investments from diaspora communities
in strategic sectors including real estate,
manufacturing, services, and infrastructure, potentially
in the form of diaspora bonds, which are used
in countries such as Ghana and Ethiopia.
6. Promoting investments in critical, climate-smart
infrastructure to improve trade and industrial development.
This will establish a path for sustainable
industrial productivity.
7. Conducting industry-related data collection, research,
and studies to increase access to industrial
information for the country.
Outcome 7: By 2027, Somaliland will have increased
decent employment for women and men, including
for young people and persons with disabilities, and
equal pay for work of equal value.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Bridging the skills mismatch between education and
the labour market. MESAF will embark on activities
geared towards skills development needed to increase
employability, especially through TVET programmes,
in collaboration with other partners, such
as the Higher Education Commission.
2. Promoting employment protection for those already
employed and labour market reforms to ease labour
market entry, especially for lower skill sectors of the
economy. This will contribute to a more competitive
labour force.
3. Promoting economic opportunities and equitable
livelihood schemes for vulnerable groups.

ENERGY AND EXTRACTIVES SECTOR
Chapter 7
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 35
7.1 Introduction
The energy and extractives (mining) sector is critically important
for Somaliland’s current and future socio-economic
development and is represented within two pillars of the
National Vision 2030. Energy is a key component of Pillar
Two (infrastructure development), with a vision for Somaliland
to become a nation with an advanced infrastructure
network that facilitates economic and social development.
Extractives has a key role in Pillar One (economic development),
which envisions a nation whose citizens enjoy
sustained economic growth and reduced poverty levels. A
sound energy sector will stimulate economic growth, social
development, agriculture productivity, industrialisation, and
mining. In this sense, the vision for the broader energy and
extractives sector is to contribute to social and economic
development through the sustainable utilisation of the
country’s energy, minerals, and petroleum resources.
The 2018 Electrical Act sets the legal frameworks for the
provision of electricity and electricity-related activities, including
the regulation of private sector players, which continues
to be a pivotal factor in the energy and extractives
sector. Similarly, in the area of extractives, the 1984 Mining
Code and Regulations are still the guiding policies in the
sub-sector. With respect to petroleum, the Upstream Petroleum
Act was passed by the parliament in 2022, whilst
other related bills are still under consideration.
Energy is key to modern economic activities and is often
regarded as one of the main enablers of business in Somaliland.
The growth and expansion of industrialisation relies
heavily on the success of government and stakeholder
interventions in the energy sector. As there is no national
grid or transmission system, all of Somaliland’s power
generation is produced close to its point of use. Only local
level distribution systems operated by private Energy Service
Providers (ESPs) exist. In this context, it should also be
noted that power generation, transmission, and distribution
are done by the same provider, and that the unbundling of
these activities is generally considered to be an important
prerequisite to improve electricity provision in the country.
Despite the challenges, recent investments by various
actors, particularly in renewable energy installations, have
improved service delivery. Similarly, streetlights, including
solar powered lights, have enabled economic activity
as well as improved security. Investments in solar water
pumps at the household and community levels have significantly
improved access to water. These small pilot projects
demonstrate the potential for continued growth in the energy
sub-sector. Key priorities are to increase efficiencies,
provide better regulation, introduce a dynamic tariff pricing
mechanism, and continue to invest in technical skills and
infrastructure.
The extractives sub-sector can potentially have positive
impacts in Somaliland on job creation, community development,
and local economies. To secure this potential,
the Somaliland government promotes the principle of
corporate social responsibility when granting exploration
rights to private companies. This can take the form of
co-financing local investments in community infrastructure,
such as health facilities, schools, the provision of education
materials, and the drilling of boreholes.
Hundreds of local people are employed either directly or
indirectly via sub-contractors in the extractives sector. Local
businesses are often sub-contracted to supply food, fuel,
vehicles, water, heavy machinery, and security services.
7.2 Situational Analysis
Energy: Policy and Legal Reforms
The energy industry in Somaliland is dominated by the
private sector as the government continues to create the
enabling environment for them to thrive. Over the period
of NDP II, various legal and policy reforms were prioritised.
Key among these are:
• The Somaliland Electrical Act, 2018
• The establishment of the Somaliland Regulatory
Commission pursuant to the Electrical Act, 2020
• The Power Masterplan, 2019
• The Draft Energy Policy, 2020
Access to Electricity
Investments by the government, development partners,
and the private sector significantly increased access to
electricity across the country. It is now estimated that 80.7
percent of Somaliland urban households and 20.3 percent
rural and nomadic households have access to electricity.
While these figures are slightly below the NDP II targets (85
percent in urban centres and 35 percent in rural centres),
the progress is impressive given the 2017 starting point of
77 percent for urban households and 17 percent for the
rural areas.
Affordability of Electricity
The general reduction in electricity tariffs over the course
of the NDP II period is significant for increasing affordability.
The average tariff reduction is estimated to be around 35
percent across the assessed major towns (Badhan, Borama,
Budhodle, Burao, Gebiley, Sheikh, Berbera, Erigavo,
Lasanod, and Hargeisa). This exceeds the target indicator
in the NDP II of 30 percent. However, the tariff reduction
is not uniform across communities. In general, increased
tariff reductions in rural areas have been set as a major
priority for the government due to disparities in access and
affordability compared to the major towns.
Relatedly, transmission losses affected consumer prices
and energy affordability. Technical losses have reduced
drastically, as reported in a 2020 losses study, from 40
percent in 2016 to approximately 32 percent in 2020. The
reduction in inefficiencies is crucial for a thriving energy
sub-sector, especially as a private sector dominated industry.
ESPs have also invested in new Transmission and
Distribution (T&D) systems with support from the government
and partners based on the T&D guidelines. Lessons
learned in the losses study continue to be relevant as the
sector moves forward.
Renewable Energy
The proportion of energy provision using renewable energy
sources is estimated to be 16.2 percent, which exceeds the
NDP II target of 10 percent. The total estimated renewable
energy capacity installed in the country is 24.4 MW out of
a total capacity of 150 MW. This is a conservative estimate,
as there are many small renewable systems that have been
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 36
installed by private businesses, public institutions, and
households (both rural and urban), that are not factored
into this estimate.
Target of investments in renewable energy technology,
infrastructure, and research for NDP II was estimated at
US$30 million cumulatively. By the end of 2021, mainly due
to multiple collaborations with partners, the total amount
invested surpassed the US$30 million target.
Improved planning helps in the efficient utilisation of limited
capacity. This is vital for both service provision and regulation.
To support this, geospatial surveys and planning was
accelerated to enable energy actors to successfully plan
electricity for each location across the country. This process
will be digitalised and available on an online platform
that can readily enable authorities to track load demand
dynamics more easily.
Extractives: Policy and Legal Reforms
To improve preparedness and the capacity to respond to
demands, the following policies and strategies were adopted:
• The Petroleum Act 2020
• The Upstream Petroleum Policy
Exploration for Oil and Gas
A multi-client 2D seismic project was developed and presented
to all international oil companies with production
sharing agreements with the government. The first project
of the multi-client arrangement was concluded in January
2018, which acquired 3,500 km of 2D seismic data for
Genel Energy on blocks SL6, SL7, SL10, and SL13. The
second project was concluded in July 2018, acquiring 800
km of 2D seismic readings for RAK Gas on block SL9. In
mid-2019, RAK Gas and Genel carried out seepage analysis
surveys. These oil and gas exploration surveys covered 17
percent of Somaliland’s land mass, exceeding the 10 percent
outcome indicator of the NPD II.
Exploration for Minerals
Mineral exploration in various forms and sizes were conducted
over the years. These projects are dispersed across
different regions. These projects include:
• Small scale jade mining
• The Abdulqadir Mining Exploration Survey
• The Dhagax Guure Mining Exploration Survey
• The Sheiklh (Sule Malable) Mining Exploration Survey
• The Laaso Surad Mining Exploration Survey
• The exploration and small-scale mining of gold in
Sanaag
• The Siimoodi Artisanal Gemstone Project
In addition, all geological data from the country has been
collected.
Revenue Generation
The revenue generated through the taxation of minerals
has increased following a modification and expansion of
mineral licenses. The different categories of licenses now
include prospecting, dealing, small mining, and quarry
licenses. Although COVID-19 affected the production and
export of minerals, in 2020-2021, the contribution of the
mining sub-sector to government revenue is estimated at
US$271,684.75.
7.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
Energy
• Expanding the capacity and quality of urban electricity
supply for domestic consumption and to support
commercial activities and industrialisation.
• Improving operational efficiencies to reduce the high
cost of electricity for all users in all regions.
• Expanding access to renewable energy to improve
the energy mix of conventional and renewable
sources.
Extractives
• Expanding the number of areas explored for minerals
and petroleum.
• Creating the laboratory capacity to analyse minerals
in Somaliland.
• Promoting investments by marketing opportunities
in the extractives sub-sector in terms of exploration,
exploitation, and value-addition (export of polished
gems).
7.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: Increase access to safe, affordable,
and reliable energy and improve efficiencies.
Outcome 1: By 2027, Somaliland’s urban electricity
supply will increase to a total of 50 megawatts for a
total of 30,000 customer connections.
The Ministry of Energy and Mining will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Strengthening the capacity of the Somaliland Energy
Commission (SEC) to regulate the electricity market,
in addition to improving the legal, regulatory, and
institutional frameworks of the sector. The key policy,
legal, and institutional reforms that will be developed
and endorsed in the coming five years include:
• An update to the National Energy Policy
• The amendment and approval of the Electrical
Energy Law No.82 (Act)
• Licensing procedures and fees for ESPs to
provide electricity
• Procedures for setting and approving tariffs
• Reviewing the national power master plan
• Creating an energy research centre
• Further developing overall human capacity in
the sector
2. Mobilising resources to invest in additional renewable
energy capacity, mini grids, off grids, and grid
extensions. This includes improving the efficiency of
existing hybrid mini grids (diesel and solar/wind) by
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 37
optimising the generation capacity and the possible
reduction of the diesel consumption by enhancing
installed capacity and hybridisation with a battery
storage system. The systems will be interconnected
with existing ESPs’ privately owned generation systems.
In line with the Power Master Plan, additional
efficient diesel generators will complement the renewable
energy component.
3. Working on viable PPP projects, using PPP guidelines
and regulations, to increase access to electricity and
improve affordability. This will be an opportunity for
rural communities to access affordable electricity.
This is the most feasible approach to provide electricity
access to marginalised and poor people in
rural and peri-urban communities.
Outcome 2: By 2027, 25% of national energy
generation will be provided by renewable energy
resources
1. Providing incentives to pilot and scale the use of appropriate
renewable energy technology. There is relatively
limited application of appropriate technology
in the production sector (agriculture, livestock, and
fisheries) and this needs to be promoted along value
chains. The usage of renewable energy and appropriate
technology can be improved in value addition
activities such as cold storage and processing. Additional
applications of solar power will be considered
for daytime water pumping for urban and agricultural
water supplies. This will free up diesel fuel costs and
permit diesel generators to be re-tasked for electricity
generation for other commercial or urban loads.
2. Investing in renewable energy capacity for the electrification
of health facilities and schools in Somaliland.
This intervention will also consider the application
of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for health
facilities, schools, and water points. This will require
the regulation of quality materials, as well as the
technical know-how to install, operate, and maintain
such systems.
3. Expanding the availability of affordable micro and
solar home systems as part of initiatives to increase
access in rural communities and reduce the cost of
energy. Incentives will be provided to the private sector
to expand the use of quality pico- and micro-grid
home-based solutions, particularly for rural and nomadic
communities. Guidelines will be developed to
support these grid extensions.
4. Piloting the use of biomass energy as an alternative
use of fuel for cooking and heating, in cooperation
with the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change.
Outcome 3: By 2027, the average electricity
price charged by the ESPs will be reduced by
15% compared to 2021 levels through increased
efficiencies in the energy value chain.
The Ministry of Energy and Mining, together with sector
stakeholders, will achieve this outcome through the following
priority interventions:
1. Establishing a city grid for Hargeisa to serve as a
distribution supply point. This will enable various
ESPs and their distribution networks to have access
to the main distribution power supply point. Additionally,
it will enable the interconnection of all current
operating ESPs in Hargeisa into a single distribution
network, operated by an independent entity.
2. Supporting other ESPs outside Hargeisa to improve
their distribution networks for better system efficiency.
3. Collaborating with ESPs to implement recommendations
from the losses study that could improve the
performance of their distribution networks. Among
other priorities, this will include smart metering and
other measures to increase the efficiency of systems
to reduce cost. This will include incorporating unmetered
customers in public and community facilities for
sustainability.
4. Using BESS to store and save energy. Despite the
initial challenges of increased technical capacity,
upfront capital costs, and system management and
maintenance, the benefits of BEES outweigh the
challenges. Recommendations on the possible applications
of batteries in hybrid solutions needs to be
revisited.
5. Developing capacity building programmes targeting
specialised skills. One of the main limiting factors
across the energy sub-sector is the lack of suitable
technicians and engineering firms that can provide
installation of and long-term maintenance for energy
systems.
Strategic Objective 2: Sustainable and environmentally
sound exploration and exploitation of the country’s minerals
and petroleum resources for the benefit of all.
Outcome 4: By 2027, 27% of Somaliland’s land mass
will have been explored for oil and gas (land mass =
177.000 sq. km).
The Ministry of Energy and Mining will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Working with lawmakers to finalise key regulations,
such as on upstream petroleum revenue and production,
as well as regulations on health and safety,
environmental protection, data management, national
content, and petroleum measurement fees, among
other key issues.
2. Continuing community engagement and development
to ensure that communities directly benefit
from the oil and gas drilling through the community
engagement programme developed during the
exploration stage. This includes outreach activities
such as the election of community committees and
community engagement officers, mobilisation workshops
for community leaders, and community awareness
raising through local media, public debates,
radio programmes, and billboards.
3. Intensifying the marketing of the extractive sub-sector,
ranging from petroleum and gas to other minerals.
This includes establishing bilateral relations and
participating in regional and global oil and gas fairs.
Subsequently, the MoEM will conduct rounds of bidding
for licenses for various empty blocks.
4. Developing capacity building programmes to imRepublic
of Somaliland National Development Plan III 38
prove the human resources of the Ministry of Energy
and Mining. These will include a mix of targeted
long-term trainings as well as short-term and onthe-
job training programmes including on geology,
gemstone cutting, and gemology.
Outcome 5: By 2027, 18% of Somaliland’s basement
area with potential for mineral exploration will have
been explored (Total area = 30,000 sq. km).
The Ministry of Energy and Mining will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Enhancing the overall contribution of the extractives
sub-sector to the economy through viable public and
private sector engagement. To improve the enabling
environment by the government, the policy and regulatory
environment needs to be improved. MoEM
will work towards the approval of both the mining
policy and code as building blocks for the sector.
2. Providing training to develop and implement the mining
and minerals regulations to continuously improve
the legal, regulatory, and institutional framework
of the sub-sector. MoEM will draft and implement
supportive regulations on environmental protection,
health and safety, licensing, and mining services.
3. Providing geographic and scientific data to investors
to reduce explorative risk. The government will provide
comprehensive primary geo-data to investors
and support the private sector, when necessary, with
additional data requirements. Additionally, the MoEM
will work on commercialising these activities to improve
sustainability.
4. Attracting investors in the exploration and exploitation
of the unoccupied mining blocks. Where it concerns
small scale local miners, the MoEM will:
• Develop training programmes for artisanal miners
to build their capacity in safe mining practices,
improved extractive techniques (including
environmental safeguards), and gem handling.
• Support training programmes for artisanal
miners, including literacy and numeracy skills,
business skills, enterprise/cooperative organisations,
and access to market information.
• Support for artisanal miners in the establishment
of cooperatives and small-scale mining
businesses.
Outcome 6: By 2027, Somaliland’s capability on
minerals laboratory analysis will be enhanced.
The Ministry of Energy and Mining will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Establishing a mineral analysis laboratory to routinely
perform multi-element analysis, targeting a wide variety
of elements in many types of sample matrices.
In addition, the laboratory will design tailor-made
analytical packages and provide a high level of standardised
service.
2. Establishing a minerals registration system and a
geo-data bank which will be available to different
stakeholders depending on needs and user access
arrangements.
Outcome 7: By 2027, increase the number of
investments in mining and value addition.
The government aims to promote exports in gemstones
that have been cut and polished, rather than only raw materials,
by:
1. Establishing a Gemstone Value Addition Centre,
where private miners will be able to bring their gemstones
for cutting and polishing services. The centre
will also provide gemstone identification services.
2. Deploying complementary measures, including
product diversification, unlocking trade restrictions,
and setting local content requirements and fiscal
policies.
3. Conducting product promotion and marketing to attract
local and international investors. The MoEM will
host mineral exhibitions, with a focus on gemstones,
for the benefit of interested investors.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 39
Observations
Outcome 1 targets improvement in access to electricity.
This activity is estimated to cost US$2.2 million. As part of
improving the energy mix and provide power from renewable
sources, an estimated US$45 million is needed to realise
Outcome 2. This is the largest proportion (77 percent)
of the investment needed for the electricity component. In
Outcome 3, interventions are geared towards affordable
electricity through reduced tariffs.
Outcomes 4 and 5 indicate progress made in the exploration
for oil, gas, and minerals. The estimated cost for the
exploration of oil and gas constitutes the highest for the
sector, amounting to US$97.2 million, while the exploration
of minerals is projected to cost US$2 million over the
planned period. For a thriving extractive industry that localises
earnings, improved capacity on laboratory analysis will
be needed, estimated to cost US$990,000 under Outcome
6. Similarly, investments will be needed to increase value
additions in the mining industry, for example in gemstones.
The interventions under Outcome 7 are estimated to cost
US$210,000.
The following outcome targets include:
• Increasing the urban centre installed energy generation
capacity by 37 percent over the planned period,
from the current 135 MW to 185 MW in 2026. This is
expected to lead to an additional 30,000 customer
connections. The MoEM indicated that currently it
cannot provide reliable data about the installed capacity
in rural areas.
• Increasing the proportion of this generation capacity
coming from renewable energy from 16 percent (of
135 MW) to 25 percent (of 185 MW), coming mainly
from already committed investments in new solar energy
systems and increasing the availability and sale
of micro-solar home systems through twelve private
sector suppliers.
• Expanding the areas explored for petroleum and
gas from 30,000 to 48,000 hectares, as well as for
minerals, from 2,373 to 5,400 hectares.
• Boosting the local economy by creating the capacity
to analyse mineral samples in-country in a local
laboratory by 2023 and promoting a local gemstone
polishing industry through the establishment of a
Gemstone Value Addition Centre.

\
PRODUCTION SECTOR
Chapter 8
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 41
8.1 Introduction
The production sector consists of the livestock, agriculture
,and fisheries sub-sectors and is important for Somaliland’s
food security.
Food security is an outcome of people’s ability to secure
access to and utilise adequate quantities of food, either by
producing it, purchasing it, or a combination of both. Similarly,
at the national level, food security can be achieved
through a combination of self-sufficiency (growing food
within the country) and self-reliance (importing food from
the world market). Food security in the Somaliland context
is intimately linked to the availability and access to water,
particularly in rural areas where agriculture and livestock
are the main livelihood sources.
Most small farmers and pastoralists are unable to feed their
households due to their narrow production base and unfavourable
terms of trade for their livestock. Their livelihood
base is not sufficiently diversified to insulate them and
their households from external shocks, most often drought.
Therefore, Somaliland relies on imports as its main source
of food supply. With high global demand and low domestic
food production, Somaliland is facing upward pressure on
food prices in the country with deteriorating terms of trade
and a larger food import bill to pay. The urban and rural
poor, disabled people, elderly people, the unemployed,
and IDPs are the most negatively affected.
Furthermore, high food prices are adversely impacting fishermen,
small farmers, and pastoralists. They are net buyers
in value terms because they sell their produce at low prices
at harvest time to finance essential needs, repay loans and
buy back the same common commodities at high prices
later in the season when they run out of their stocks. The
dollarised market has other negative consequences which
hardly documented.
The interventions from the production sector have therefore
to be seen in the wider context of food and water
security. The Somaliland Food & Water Security Strategy
(2011) was formulated by the Government of Somaliland
through a consultative and participatory process under
the guidance of the Ministry of Planning and National Development,
with technical support from the UN Food and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the International Fund for
Agriculture Development (IFAD), the UN Development Programme
(UNDP), the World Food Programme (WFP), and
other development partners.
Although more than ten years old, the basic premises of
the Somaliland Food & Water Security Strategy have not
changed, and based on its situational analysis three out of
seven strategic goals are directly relevant to the production
sector:
• Increase agricultural production and productivity
(crops, livestock, and fisheries)
• Develop export markets for livestock and fisheries,
including added-value products
• Improve nutrition and food safety
8.2 Situational analysis
Livestock
Somaliland has a large livestock population estimated at
18.6 million, consisting mainly of camels, sheep and goats,
and cattle. Livestock is a valuable asset for the national
economy, contributing in most years to more than 80 percent
of foreign exchange earnings. It plays a crucial role in
rural poverty reduction with significant effects on the livelihoods
of people in rural areas. As such, there is a strong
case to invest in the development of the livestock value
chain.
The nomadic and agro-pastoralist systems characterise the
country’s livestock industry. The nomadic pastoralists keep
small herds of sheep, goats, and camels for subsistence.
In nomadic livelihoods, pasturelands are mostly communal.
On the other hand, agro-pastoralists keep smaller herds
of mostly cattle, goats, and a few camels, and grow crops
in rain-fed farms. The dominant land use is pasture-based
livestock production on communal land in varying scales of
intensity. The main livestock products include milk, ghee,
meat, hides, skins, manure, and draught power.
Type of livestock Estimated population
Camels 1.6 million
Sheep and goats 16.6 million
Cattle 0.4 million

Sector Human Resource Requirements and Plans in
2012
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 42
Rangelands
Somaliland has diverse ecosystems, including coastal
plains, escarpments, plateaus, and woodlands. Goats and
camels thrive more in the woodlands (Hawd) and escarpments,
whereas sheep, cattle, and donkeys flourish in open
plains. Rural households often keep a few donkeys for
domestic transport. The number of cattle shrunk in the past
ten years because of successive droughts and dwindling
indigenous grass species.
The productivity of the Somaliland rangelands has been
declining over the decades due to climate change, livestock
population increases, poor natural resource management,
uncontrolled land grabbing, and limited policy
enforcement. The government destroys illegal enclosures
from time to time, but with limited success.
Fodder Production in Private Enclosures
The agro-pastoralists conserve fodder in their enclosures
while competing with the nomadic pastoralists in the common
grazing lands during wet seasons. The landowners either
leave the grass in the field for the animals to graze on
during dry spells or cut and pile it in their homesteads. The
farmers also store sorghum and maize stalks for the same
purpose. During recent droughts, when pastures became
scarce and fodder reserves were exhausted, the herders
fed animals with boiled grains and other complementary
feeds.
Landowners cut grass with sickles and pile it on higher
grounds on the farm or carry it to the homestead. The grass
is often cut when very dry, but ideally should be cut when
still green. The quality of the fodder is affected by excessive
heat, rain, and strong winds. When taking it to other
locations, the fodder is heaped on trucks with ropes, rather
than baled, which is more efficient.
Grazing Reserves
The establishment of grazing reserves in strategically
chosen locations is an important measure taken during
droughts to increase resilience. The areas can also be used
as livestock holding grounds.
According to data from the Ministry of Environment and
Climate Change (MoECC), a total of 116,700 hectares of
grazing reserves have been brought under community
management. This is an area where coordination and cooperation
between MoLFD and the MoECC are of crucial
importance. The ministries simultaneously achieve important
targets for the livestock sector and improved environmental
management.
The grazing reserve in the Aroori plateau, located between
the towns of Burao and Odweyne, is a prime example of
indigenous plant species regeneration. Closing strategic
locations across the country would enhance the gene
preservation and regeneration of indigenous plants.
Livestock Exports
Livestock exports are important for income generation,
government revenue, foreign currency earnings, and the
exchange of other commodities, including food.
Livestock exports represent, in most years, more than 80
percent of the value of Somaliland’s exports. The Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Yemen, Oman, and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) are the main destinations for Somaliland
livestock exports. Saudi Arabia is the main destination for
small ruminants (sheep and goats) as 70 percent of the
exports takes place during the Muslim Hajj season. Yemen
and Oman are two major destinations for cattle exports.
Only male animals are exported whilst the females are
reserved for breeding and domestic use.
Based on health grounds, importing countries imposed
several bans on livestock exports from Somalia’s ports.
Saudi Arabia was responsible for most of the bans, based
on claims that it found Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in Somali livestock.
Livestock exportation data from 2010-2021 shows
a steep decline since 2016, mainly due to large livestock
mortality from droughts. For example, 3,175,650 sheep and
goats were exported through Somaliland’s ports in 2015,
compared to only 864,179 in 2021.
Heavy dependence on the three month-long Hajj season
for livestock exports puts pastoralists in a difficult income
situation, as the sale of animals is the main source of
household income. Alternative markets outside of Hajj
season must be explored to spread out pastoralist income
opportunities throughout the year.
Although there are significant external factors that affect
the export of live animals, the MoLFD should:
• Rigorously implement all international animal health
requirements (vaccinations, quarantines, certifications,
risk-based disease analysis, etc.) for the export
of livestock.
• Build and maintain effective infrastructure, including
quarantine stations, livestock holding grounds, and
community managed grazing reserves (in collaboration
with the MoECC).
• Promote public and private partnerships to ensure
the availability of water and fodder at key spots along
livestock trading routes.
Moreover, the MoLFD, with support from development partners,
should commission extensive marketing research to
identify opportunities for the export of live animals, meats,
and meat products.
The Domestic Livestock Market
Although less important in volume than livestock exports,
there is an important domestic market for meat consumption,
mainly in urban areas. Depending on the year, the
domestic livestock market is estimated to be about 20-50
percent of the live-animal export market. As a result of its
size, the domestic livestock market can only absorb the
livestock export market to a small degree. The seven main
urban centres’ slaughterhouses, where a majority of animals
are brought for slaughter, need substantial improvements.
Data from urban slaughterhouses is readily available,
whereas reliable records in the semi-urban and rural
areas are not available as most animals are slaughtered in
the homestead. Animals slaughtered for domestic use are
mostly consumed on the same day. Butchers sell the meat
spread on tables in open markets with minimum sanitary
standards. The MoLFD should set sanitary standards and
inspect meat markets.
Despite the sharp decline in livestock exportation in recent
years, the price of meat in the local markets remains
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 43
beyond the economic means of poor urban households.
Red meat is the only commodity in Somaliland that is not
imported. This creates an opportunity for chicken and fish
consumption, as they are relatively cheaper products.
Dairy Products
Nomadic pastoralists keep mixed camel herds for milk
production and continually migrate in search of water and
pasture. Agro-pastoralists, on the other hand, mostly reside
in the western regions and rear dairy cattle of East African
Zebu type. The herders send the daily milk yields of their
herds in plastic containers to their agents in the markets.
The plastic containers, mostly with small necks, are often
not properly sterilised. For improved preservation, the
milk is pasteurised or sterilized by heating, or sometimes
antibiotics are added. The MoLFD should inspect milk in
the local markets for antibiotics that cause antibiotic resistance.
The ministry has registered 15 milk cooperatives in
urban centres.
Milk consumption is high, both in urban and rural locations,
as milk is often the only accessible and affordable drink
and is traditionally important for pastoral communities. The
high demand for milk is stymied by supply bottlenecks and
a lack of capacity in the dairy process industry. At the same
time, water and electricity, which are crucial for dairy processing,
are expensive in Somaliland and are not always
reliably accessible.
The prevailing demand for milk is supplemented by the
importation of powdered and bottled milk, mainly sourced
from Saudi Arabia, Yemen, New Zealand, and Holland,
among others. In the period from 2019-2021, the country
imported 35,601,103 kg of powdered milk and 23,072,179
kg of bottled milk, which extracted millions of USD from the
country (Ministry of Finance Customs Office, 2022).
Businesspeople and diaspora groups are increasingly establishing
commercial dairy camel farms on the outskirts of
cities. The milk from these farms is transported in standard
metallic containers to restaurants and distribution centres
twice a day. With increased urbanisation, the demand for
milk and other dairy products remains high and the current
supply cannot satisfy market demands. Hence, the importation
of powdered milk and other dairy products.
An estimated 50-60 percent of the milk produced in Somaliland
comes from camels. Cow milk contributes about
35 percent of total production, while goat and sheep’s milk
make up 10 percent. The processing of dairy products into
yogurt and cheese is limited. There is also a small industry
that processes milk from imported powder milk.
Hides and Skins
The export of hides and skins, although potentially important,
has dropped from approximately 13.5 million total
exports in 2011 to less than two million annually in recent
years. Value addition in hides, skins, leather, and leather
products would foster the diversification of Somaliland
exports. According to a recent study, the hides and skin
sub-sector employs over 1,190 individuals (88 percent of
which are male).
The exportation of hides and skins from Somaliland has
drastically declined since 2019 and only limited quantities
are now exported to Gulf countries. Chinese companies
were historically the major buyers of Somaliland hides and
skins, but they moved to Tanzania following the closing of
the Dacarbudhuq tannery due to environmental concerns.
Traditionally, hides and skins are mainly cured through
salting and drying (dry salting). Hides and skins are often of
low quality due to defects accumulated before, during, and
after the slaughtering of animals.
The development of a policy framework for leather production
should, among priorities, emphasise improving the
quality of hides and skins and upgrading the existing animal
slaughter facilities. Other aspects should include the
adoption of salt recovery technologies such as those being
used in tanneries in Ethiopia, to make the industry more
environmentally friendly, and the intensification of value
addition beyond the wet blue stage to produce finished
leathers as well as leather products.
Disease Control and Prevention
Measures
The disease control and prevention measures implemented
by the MoLFD consist mainly of vaccinating sheep and
cattle, the mandatory quarantine of live animals for export,
general disease control, treating parasites, and oversight of
veterinary medicine imports.
Disease control and vaccination interventions are conducted
across Somaliland twice per year. With the financial and
material assistance of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO), and other development partners, the MoLFD
carries out periodic vaccination and treatment campaigns.
Somaliland lacks a vaccine production institute to be able to
produce inexpensive vaccines and prevent transboundary
animal diseases of economic significance from impacting
national herds.
Egg Production
Somali society traditionally does not appreciate white
meat. Nevertheless, twelve small to medium poultry farms
have recently been established in the country. On average,
a poultry farm holds between 300 and 60,000 chickens,
mostly for laying eggs. European breeds are kept on farms,
which have a difficult time adapting to the local weather
and existing endemic diseases. The core limitations of
the poultry industry include the high feed cost, lack of
local availability of chicks, limited experience of farmers
in poultry rearing, and absence of local agencies that produce
low-cost vaccines for the control of endemic poultry
diseases.
Some households keep a few hens of the local breed, mostly
for egg production. If well managed, small-scale poultry
rearing can be a good source of supplementary income for
households. The local breeds are characterised by low production
and productivity, and established farms with local
breeds are for egg production. Therefore, imported chilled
chicken is available in supermarkets. The ministry should
encourage the establishment of farms for broilers.
Agriculture
Sorghum is the dominant crop in Somaliland, taking up
about 70 percent of the rain-fed farmlands. Another 25
percent is covered by maize, mainly grown as food for
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 44
human consumption. Other crops are cowpea, sesame,
watermelon, millet, groundnut, and beans. Around 20-25
percent of the Somaliland population depends directly on
the agriculture sector for their livelihoods and means of
employment, particularly in rural settings. Crop production
contributes to only 10 percent of cereal consumption in
Somaliland.
The Ministry of Agriculture’s National Agriculture Strategic
Plan (NASP, 2021-2023), defines the following strategic
goals:
1. Increase agricultural production
2. Improve access to agricultural markets and marketing
services
3. Promote natural resource management
Policy and Legal Reform
• National Agriculture Atrategic Plan (NASP) 2021-
2023
• National Agriculture policy (draft)
• Seed policy (draft)
• National pesticides policy (draft)
• Draft agriculture cooperatives policy
• Dryland Farming
The agro-pastoralists in the dryland areas grow a six month
maturing sorghum variety (Elmi Jama) for human food and
fodder for livestock. In addition, a short cycle variety has
recently been introduced in the Odweyne district. To cope
with unpredictable climatic patterns, farmers also grow
maize, cowpeas, millet, and beans for food, plus sesame,
watermelon, groundnuts, onions, and tomatoes as cash
crops. Dryland farmers are also steadily adopting fruit
trees such as citrus, guava, lemons, and mangoes through
improvised drip irrigation during the sapling and flowering
stages.
Most subsistence farmers use appropriate farming techniques
passed down from generation to generation. It
is a low-input, low-output farming system, which has not
changed much over time. Technology transfer has shown
very little success, despite heavy investments by NGOs in
farmer training. Both the total area under cultivation and
the yield per hectare fluctuate heavily from year to year,
mainly as the result of rainfall patterns.
Main Crop Production Areas
Rain-fed farming is suitable in pockets across the country.
Maroodi Jeex, Awdal, and Togdheer are the main food
baskets of Somaliland, where farmers practice both rainfed
and small-scale irrigated farming. Agro-pastoralists in
the Sanaag and Sahil regions also grow sorghum, mostly
for animal fodder. Farmers in those regions also grow cash
crops along the dry rivers and streams through irrigation
from shallow wells.
Commercial Farming
Investment in agri-businesses seems to have increased
during the last five years, although no reliable data is
available. This seems to have taken place without any noticeable
assistance from either the Ministry of Agricultural
Development (MoAD) or aid organisations. Commercial
farming could be a key driver to market-oriented sustainable
agricultural development, which reduces widespread
poverty in rural areas. Based on basic technical know-how,
these farmers produce quality fruits and vegetables, largely
for major markets in large cities and towns.
Greenhouses for commercial vegetable production are expanding
in both dryland and irrigated farming areas. These
enterprises use hybrid and genetically modified seeds and
apply both chemical and organic fertilizers and pesticides.
Commercial farming is often done without sufficient research
on the soil type, appropriateness of seeds, climate,
market demand and conditions, and quality of water for
irrigation. Farmers also often do not consider the shelf lives
and preservation of farm produce when the markets are
unfavourable. Nevertheless, there are successful commercial
farming enterprises in the Arabsio and Burao areas.
Agricultural Research and Extension
The NASP expresses MoAD’s commitment to ensuring that:
• Agricultural production is increased through farmer-
focused training and extension to enable the
farmer to utilise appropriate farming techniques and
technologies
• Enhanced institutional capacity exists to plan, develop,
and provide agricultural support packages that
are sustainable
• The focus will be on quality farm produce and improved
marketing, leading to national food security
Finding appropriate technologies and disseminating them
to farmers under agro-socio-ecological conditions like in
Somaliland is a complex challenge anywhere in the world.
This is even more challenging due to the face that there
are currently no ongoing broad-based agricultural research
and extension interventions in the country.
1. Research: The MoAD manages the dryland Agriculture
Research and Training Institute (SIAR) at Aburin
Agricultural Research Station, which has been rehabilitated
with funds from the Somaliland Development
Fund as a farmer’s training and on-farm varietal
evaluation centre. The institute is located about 42
kilometres outside of Hargeisa city, within Somaliland’s
prime dryland agro-ecological zone. Farmers
from across the country take theoretical and practical
short training courses at the SIAR and serve as junior
extension workers in their respective localities. The
MoAD and partners should commission a study exploring
the relevant technology for the local farming
systems. It would take time and needs functional
links with agricultural research stations operating in
similar agro-climatic zones. In this context, the MoAD
must pursue stronger collaborative institutional links
with relevant Consultative Group for International
Agricultural Research institutes, a global partnership
that unites international organisations engaged in
research about food security.
2. Extension: The agricultural extension department
has limited capacity in terms of effective boots on
the ground, so conventional ways of getting valid
cropping messages to farmers through a national
network of field-level extension workers are not feasible.
Therefore, in collaboration with development
partners, the MoAD transfers appropriate farming and
natural resource management techniques through
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 45
Farmer Field Schools (FFS) and demonstration farms.
The MoAD must find innovative, demand-driven,
cand ost-effective ways to reach and support farmers.
Agricultural Inputs and Credit
Both supply and demand for agricultural inputs – like certified
seeds, pesticides, implements, equipment, etc. – are
very limited and dispersed. Local dealers sell poor-quality
imported farm inputs from overseas due to limited control
and quality guarantee mechanisms. Genetically modified
and untested vegetable and horticulture seeds from diverse
sources are replacing indigenous seeds. On the other
hand, farmers store seeds of cereal and legume crops
from their harvest, purchase them from open food markets,
or receive them through donations. Since farmers cannot
easily access credits, traders often pre-finance the farmers
and take the products at prices that may not be fair to the
producers.
Although the ministry and its development partners promote
climate-smart agriculture, including the use of organic
pesticides, farmers often use globally banned chemical
products and apply them to crops at different stages,
including a few days before harvesting. Also, farmers use
animal manure for enhancing soil fertility.
Agricultural Markets
The cash crops from the local farms are mostly consumed
in the main towns of Somaliland. Farmers recognise that
local harvests cannot satisfy market demand, and as a
result, similar commodities are imported from Ethiopia and
Somalia. The farmers send their products to their marketing
agents, or traders purchase the harvests at the farm gate.
The vegetables and fruits are transported to the markets
in small crates, carton boxes, and sacks on trucks. The
peasant farmers face numerous problems, such as poor
access to markets, high transportation costs, unstable market
prices, lack of processing facilities (value addition), and
ineffective farmer organisations.
Non-public Stakeholders
The MoAD collaborates with international and local partners
to realise the NASP milestones. About 20 partners
support the ministry in enhancing the technical skills of
the farmers and staff, natural resource management, water
for irrigation, climate change, tillage hours, seeds, etc. The
partners also invest in strengthening farmer organisations.
The engagement strategy of most NGOs focuses mainly
on emergency management and implementing resilience
programmes, which may include farmer group training,
distribution of inputs, water-harvesting, construction of
soil bunds, and/or support of income generation activities
through market gardening.
The MoAD must step up its efforts to coordinate stakeholders
in the sector and jointly identify potential interventions
for upscaling.
Fisheries
The fishery sector is recognised as a vital economic driver
for job creation and economic growth in Somaliland. Although
meat consumption is high in the urban areas, the
consumption of fish is limited, and fish consumption needs
to be promoted to spur the market.
The MoLFD is mandated to regulate and promote the Somaliland
fishery sector. However, the sector is still in the
early stages of development, and the legal and regulatory
frameworks that ensure effective governance are still being
introduced, developed, and enforced.
The Somaliland Fishery Law is the only legal framework for
the fishery industry. FAO and other development partners
work with the MoLFD in reviewing and formulating its policy
framework.
Legal Frameworks
The legal frameworks governing the fishers are fragmented
and the implementation and enforcement have gaps. The
Somaliland Government has introduced the following legal
instruments:
• Somaliland Fishery Law (Law No. 84/2018); it was
recently revised and amended and will be submitted
to the Cabinet.
• Registration & Licensing of Fishing Vessels (No.
1/08/2012). The ministry worked on a fishery vessel
registration exercise in 2022 and 455 fishery vessels
were registered and are active in Somaliland waters.
The ministry issues licenses to foreign fishing vessels
for limited periods with specified fishing equipment.
• Somaliland company law gives licenses to fishing
groups operating as companies.
• A fishery boat management regulation was developed
in 2022.
• Cooperative guidelines were developed in 2022, as
well as bylaws for cooperatives.
The MoLFD issues identification numbers and cards to the
boats and fishermen, and licenses for the local and foreign
fishing companies and cooperatives. The SLCG ensures
compliance with the regulations for every sea-going boat
and its crew. In addition, the government collects taxes
from fishing activities.
Equipment and Facilities for Fishing
Groups and Fishmongers
The Somaliland artisanal fishery sector predominantly operates
in the inshore areas. Most fishermen use motorized
boats equipped with drift nets and lines for catching the
fish. About 250 small and medium-scale boats of 7 m and
8.5m long, equipped with 15 and 25 hp Yamaha engines,
are used for fishing. The small boats are useful for the daily
catch within a few kilometres from the shore, whilst the
medium-scale boats, mostly with Volvo engines, can spend
over a week at sea and sail up to 50km from the shore. In
addition, individual fishers go to the sea on paddled canoes
to catch small quantities of fish.
Fishing boats are insulated or equipped with coolers to
preserve the fish on the boats while at sea. Fishers take
sufficient quantities of ice flakes, packaged in 50 kg bags,
depending on the fishing trip. The boat owners employ
fishermen (4-5 per boat) for each fishing trip.
Fishing jetties were established and are operational in
coastal Berbera and Maydh towns. The ministry also manRepublic
of Somaliland National Development Plan III 46
ages a workshop in Berbera town for repairing boats and
fishing gear, which are relatively expensive in Somaliland.
The boat owners order the fishing gear and spare parts from
Bossaso, Mogadishu, or Dubai, where they are cheaper.
Cold Chain Facilities
There are limited cold storage facilities in Somaliland’s
coastal towns. The fishmongers store fish stocks in freezers
of 500 kg capacity whereas six enterprises have cold
chains and icemaking plants, mostly in Berbera town, for
short-term storage. The enterprises serve the fishermen
and the fishmongers in the Berbera district with ice cubes
and storage facilities. A kilogram of ice costs SlSh 1000
(US$0.12 USD) in Berbera.
In addition, the Fishery Centre Enterprise, constructed
by Fairfishing in Berbera and currently managed by the
ministry, has a freezer room to freeze the fish to -40 oC for
indefinite periods. However, the room is seldom used due
to expensive and unreliable electricity in Berbera.
Fish Species in Somaliland Waters
The fish species in Somaliland waters are classified into
pelagic (migratory) and demersal (sedentary). The Pelagic
species include the tuna family (yellowfin tuna, frigate tuna,
longtail tuna, sailfish tuna, skipjack tuna, etc.) and Spanish
mackerel. The common demersal species are scavengers,
groupers, snappers, grunts, sharks, turtles, threadfin
breams, lizardfish, goatfish, rays, and sea breams.
Despite Somaliland society historically consisting of nomadic
pastoralists with plenty consumption of red meat,
fish consumption has been steadily growing in the urban
areas due to the expatriate and diaspora returnee populations,
as well as due to health benefits, nutrition, and media
influences. Yellowfin tuna, long-tail tuna, sailfish tuna,
sharks, and kingfish are the most preferred fish species in
the consumer markets for their high unit value and slow
decomposition. The fish’s body mass and consumer preference
determine the price of the fish in the market. Although
Somaliland’s 850 km sealine is endowed with rich fishery
resources, local fish consumption is relatively limited.
Seasonal Fish Production and Marketing
Access to the sea and availability of fish is determined by
the southwest and northeast monsoons. Between May
and August (sometimes mid-September), the southwest
monsoon makes the sea cold and rough for the small
boats. In this season, access to the pelagic fish species
(the preferred) becomes scarce in Somaliland waters, as
they migrate to places with higher ambient temperatures.
Between September and April, pelagic fish species are
abundant in the Gulf of Aden because of a higher ambient
temperature and the availability of prey.
Opportunities exist for investors to partner with local fishing
companies or invest in developing the fishing industry. No
official fishery stock assessment was conducted for the
last 30 years to determine the status of the fishery stock
in Somaliland waters and determine the potential of the
industry, which FAO currently estimates at 40,000 tonnes
per year. However, the annual registered catch over the last
few years has been around 3,000 tonnes, or less than 10
percent of the estimated potential.
Fish Markets
The fishmongers send the fish stocks on improved vans
with large quantities of ice cubes. Around 80 percent of
the fish catch ends up in Hargeisa and Burao cities, while
smaller quantities go to Borama, Erigavo, Wajaale, Gabiley,
Odweyne, and Las Anod towns. The ministry and development
partners have established fish markets in Berbera
and Burao towns with the necessary facilities.
The fishmongers sell a kilo of fish at SlSh 13,000( US$1.5)
and resell it at SlSh 18,000 (≈US$2) to the traders at the end
markets, who in turn sell each kilo at around SlSh 29,000
(US$3.4) to hotels and restaurants, and SlSh 40,000
($US4.7) to individual customers.
Foreign Fishing in Somaliland Waters
The MoLFD issues fishing licenses to large foreign vessels
for a limited period in the Somaliland Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ). Somaliland charges US$0.46 per kilogram of
fish on licensed foreign vessels. Due to limited monitoring
capacity, the ministry, however, is concerned that foreign
vessels of all sizes are illegally encroaching into the Somaliland
territorial waters. Illegal fishing has huge impacts
on the marine habitats and sustainability of fish species
from destroying coral reefs and using trawling equipment.
Despite small units of navy guards in the coastal towns,
Somaliland is ill-equipped to monitor and protect its marine
resources. In the recent past, between 2017 and 2019,
foreign trawlers were banned from Somaliland waters to
protect the coral reefs. The ministry currently only issues a
very limited number of licenses to foreign operators.
Commercial Fish Processing
Large-scale fish processing is still developing in Somaliland.
Few companies have emerged in the past two decades
to produce, preserve, and market for commercial purposes.
However, those companies have either closed their
businesses or managed only ice plants and cold storage
facilities in Berbera town.
8.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major identified challenges in the production sector for
the NDP III period are the following:
Livestock
• Improving rangeland management and preservation,
including in local communities as indigenous plant
species are being replaced by exotic species, such
as prosopis juliflora and parthenium weed. Trees are
also cut indiscriminately for firewood and charcoal
production in many places.
• Investing in a meat processing industry, as livestock
is exported on the hoof. The recipient countries often
send back livestock shipments from Somaliland
because of enzootic diseases such as brucellosis.
Exporting chilled meat would add value and increase
earnings in foreign currency, as well as reduce the
risk of rejected shipments and high mortality of livestock
enroute.
• Improving sanitary measures for livestock and the
handling of livestock products, like meat and milk.
For example, it is important to avoid the spread of
disease when livestock from different locations
converge in unsanitary conditions. Regulations and
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 47
inspection need to improve to impose better hygiene
and sales conditions in markets.
Agriculture
• Improving the subsector’s policy, legal, and regulatory
framework. The ministry has a three year strategic
plan (2021-2023), a draft national agriculture
policy, a seed policy, a plant protection policy, and a
farming cooperatives’ policy. Furthermore, the ministry
should review the Somaliland Agriculture Land
Ownership Law No. 08/99 in line with the recently
approved land policy.
• Addressing in a more systematic way land conservation,
management, and erosion control, together with
other relevant government institutions, like MoLFD,
MoECC, and MoRD. Soil fertility in agricultural areas
has declined over time due to poor farming practices,
inadequate natural resource management, and wind
and water erosion.
• Mobilising additional resources so the MoAD is better
placed to pursue its national mandate of creating
an enabling environment for sustainable agricultural
production. This would enhance the capacity of the
ministry to identify, formulate, and enforce sectoral
policies and guidelines and deliver necessary services
to farmers, including training, certified seeds,
and on-farm trials.
• Promoting private sector investments in activities
like crop production, agro-processing, horticultural
production in greenhouses, and the availability of
quality agricultural inputs, equipment, and facilities.
To increase crop production, farmers should be able
to access quality and regulated certified seeds, farm
machinery, botanical pesticides, affordable fuel for
tillage, and irrigation facilities, among others.
• Promoting practices that reduce crop losses from
pests and diseases or from inadequate on-farm storage
facilities.
• Promoting better access to markets. Despite the
extensive mobile phone network in Somaliland and
other modern communication technologies, local
farmers either have limited market information or are
bonded to pre-financing traders in the end markets.
In addition, farmers lose a significant percentage of
yield value due to market saturation with unfavourable
prices immediately after the harvest.
Fisheries
• Improving the availability of information about the
status of Somaliland’s marine ecosystem i.e., coral
reefs, sponges, and seaweeds, which are the main
habitat of many organisms. This information is important
for investors, fishermen, and other stakeholder
who wish to invest in the fishing sector.
• Establishing a standby rescue system for stranded
fishermen and missing properties in the sea. The
fishermen (fish harvesters) do not have diving kits
to search for missing properties (e.g., anchors) and
persons in distress. Fishing groups now employ private
boats for rescue operations and hire expensive
kits from local vendors for such incidents. The municipality
occasionally contributes fuel for the rescue
operations, while the Somaliland Coastguard may
tow the boats back to shore.
• Promoting the availability of essential tools, gear, and
equipment for fishermen (like fish detecting instruments,
GPRS, overcoats, life jackets, fire distinguishers,
communication equipment, and first aid kits) and
fishmongers at the markets (like proper gutting and
filleting knives, weighing scales, and cutting boards).
Storms and cyclones may capsize the fishing boats
far into the sea. When stranded in the sea, the boats
do not have communication facilities to appeal for
assistance whilst the rescue mission cannot easily
locate the distressed crew.
• Promoting measures that will allow the availability of
cost-effective cold-chain facilities and rental space
accessible to fishmongers, while guaranteeing the
stability of a sustainable electricity supply.
• Expansion of the Berbera fishery jetty, which currently
can handle only a few boats at any given time. This
results in long queues for access to the landing site
which can cause the fish to perish if not unloaded
and frozen on time. Also, an unhygienic landing site
may contaminate the fish.
• Additional investments to improve transport infrastructure.
The traders deliver fish on improvised
vans, which do not meet the fish delivery standards,
compounded by poor road networks and other infrastructure.
A significant percentage of fish stocks are
lost before consumption due to poor handling and
inadequate cooling systems while in transit, making
postharvest losses unnecessarily high.
• Working towards meeting Hazard Analysis Critical
Control Point (HACCP) standards in the fishery sector.
This would allow it to export fish to neighbouring
countries, Europe, or the United States. Somaliland’s
fishery sector currently supplies only the local markets
and exports only insignificant amounts of ornamental
fish to Djibouti.
• Promoting eating and preparing fish to challenge the
cultural attachment to red meat and limited cooking
skills. Cultural factors discourage many people from
eating fish and has caused several companies to
leave the market within a short period.
8.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: To improve resilience and livelihoods
of rural communities by promoting sustainable production
in livestock and agriculture with sound natural resource
management.
Outcome 1: By 2027, livelihoods in rural and semi-rural
areas will have improved due to better resilience in
pastoralist and agro-pastoralist communities.
In collaboration with development partners, the Ministry of
Livestock and Fishery Development will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Improving access to effective animal health services
through quality drugs, disease surveillance, treatment,
and vaccination campaigns.

INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR
Chapter 9
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 52
9.1 Introduction
Infrastructure is key to facilitating and accelerating socio-
economic development as envisaged in Somaliland
Vision 2030. The country aims to be a nation with an advanced
infrastructure network that enables economic and
social development. Therefore, improved infrastructure is
critical to Somaliland’s competitiveness to facilitate local,
regional, and global trade. The priority has always been
an internal road network that connects the different parts
of the country, which will also indirectly support economic
activities such as being a transit trade hub, access to health
facilities, and linking production to potential markets.
It was in pursuit of the above objectives that, in addition
to the Berbera-Wajaale road, the Hargeisa bypass was
conceived, together with partners. Other strategic road
networks include connections between Erigavo, Burao,
and Las Anod. This will then establish good, paved road
links between all the regional capitals and major cities.
Closely linked to the road network are developments in
the maritime transport infrastructure. The Berbera Port and
its economic zone are intertwined with the existing road
network and planned road investments. The Berbera Port
is quickly becoming the nucleus of economic opportunities
in Somaliland. This ranges from being a major source of
government revenues to being a key hub in the international
livestock trade. The development of other jetties, like
the one in Maydh, expands opportunities for more rural
communities. To realize its full potential, Somaliland also
needs a thriving aviation industry. Developments at Egal
International and Berbera airports will ensure that connectivity
to Somaliland is easy for its citizens and businesses.
The recent resumption of domestic flights to Erigavo signals
opportunities for domestic air connectivity.
The basis for a modern digital economy is a transformative
telecommunication sector which adopts to the fast-changing
digital world. As envisioned in Vision 2030, a good
communication network will support the government’s
drive towards a modern digital world. This is expected to
support e-economy, e-government, and e-learning. The
government’s main role is to create the enabling environment
for the private sector to thrive. The recent developments
on the fibre optic cable deployment will further boost
the industry and ensure that internet access and internal
supported economic activities will increase. Connectivity
to the international fibre optic cable will also help increase
internet access to every home, business, school, and government
department.
9.2 Situational Analysis
Policy and Legal Reforms
Policy and legal instruments approved and enacted to
improve the infrastructure landscape are limited. These
policies, and a host of new ones, will continue to guide the
sector in the foreseeable future. Key among them are:
• Four sustainable urban master plans developed for
Las Anod, Erigavo, Borama, and Gabiley districts.
• Land Policy (2022)
• Fixed Asset Registry Policy
• E-Government Strategy (2021-2024)
Public Works, Land, and Housing
• The Ministry of Public Works, Land and Housing
(MoPWLH) archives the original copies of all town
plans in the country and maintains an asset register
of public assets. There are currently 15,428 assets
registered in the asset registry. The MoPWLH licenses
an increasing number of engineers and skilled
technicians, as well as the registration of building
contractors, real estate developers, and quarries.
Currently, the MoPWLH has registered 1,465 contractors
and 1,550 engineers. The contractor licensing requires
the owner to have engineering qualifications.
• The ministry has developed construction permit
application guidelines and trained the ministry and
district engineers in implementing the guidelines for
the approval and oversight of building permit applications.
The ministry has designed and supervised
182 projects since its inception in 1994.
• MoPWLH works closely with the Ministry of Transport
and Roads Development (MoTRD) and local governments
to identify primary and secondary roads to
plan and manage cities’ traffic volumes. This is taken
into consideration when conducting town planning.
• The MoPWLH has completed the feasibility studies
and detailed design of 400 government employee
houses. The MoPWLH has allocated public-owned
land for the construction of affordable housing and is
currently exploring potential funding sources.
Road Transport
• Community fundraising has been a critical source
of finance for constructing paved roads in rural and
urban areas. Examples of such funding models are
the roads connecting Borama and Dila (35 km), Hargeisa
and Ina Guuhaa (about 30 km out of 80 km),
Hargeisa and Balligubadle (about 15 km out of 80
km), and Erigavo and Ina Af-Madow (about 150 km
out of 280 km).
• The Roads Development Authority (RDA), together
with key partners, has delivered several vital roads.
Since 2013, Somaliland, together with the SDF, has
invested in the rehabilitation of 149.5 km of paved
roads, which included 130.3 km of paved road between
Hargeisa and Sheik and rehabilitating 19.2 km
of paved road between Kala-baydh and Dila.
• The upgrades to the Berbera Corridor, which links
the Berbera Port to Ethiopia, are significant developments.
Road upgrades will be completed by the
end of 2022 with investments from the Abu Dhabi
Fund (US$90 million), the Prosperity Fund of the UK
Government (US$33 million) for the Hargeisa Bypass,
and the European Union, which has upgraded the
road from the bypass to Gabiley. The RDA has been
a key partner in this process. Berbera Port, Berbera
Airport and the Berbera Corridor Road connecting to
Ethiopia are nearly completed.
• The Erigavo road, constructed with government
funds and an extensive community fundraising effort,
both in Somaliland and from the diaspora, is expected
to be completed at the end of 2022. Despite this
progress, infrastructure remains one of the biggest
challenges for businesses in Somaliland, particularly
transportation.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 53
Maritime Transport
• There is a new container terminal at Berbera Port,
a quay of 400 m, and three Ship-to-Shore (STS)
gantry cranes which can handle the largest container
vessels in operation today and increases the port’s
container capacity from the current 150,000 Twenty-
Foot Equivalent Units (TEUs) to 500,000 TEUs
annually. The terminal includes a modern container
yard with eight Rubber-Tyred Gantry Cranes (RTGs).
A new port one-stop service centre is also being built
and will be ready in 2022. The port can handle up to
two million TEUs a year and multiple large container
vessels simultaneously.
• Recent investments, albeit small, in regional jetties
have the potential to develop an interconnected marine
transportation network which will open potential
markets, promote value chains, and improve local
economic development in many rural areas.
• The Maydh Jetty in Sanaag has also been upgraded,
which will improve interconnectivity by sea between
Berbera and Sanaag and parts of the Togdheer regions.
It is expected that with complementary investments
in the road to Erigavo, this upgrade could spur
economic potential benefiting about 750,000 people
and providing opportunities for economic diversification
with investments in the fisheries sector.
Air Transport
• Air access has improved in recent times, with four
international airlines currently operating in the country
providing daily flights from Mogadishu, Djibouti,
Addis Ababa, and Dubai. The United Nations and the
European Commission have weekly humanitarian
flights linking neighbouring countries.
• Berbera International Airport reopened for international
air travel in November 2021. The airport
upgrades complemented the expanded port of Berbera,
and both play an important role in the potential
success of the SEZ in Berbera, which will transform
Berbera into an integrated maritime, industrial and
logistics hub in the Horn of Africa.
• The government has rehabilitated the Erigavo airport
with an unpaved runway and currently there are local
flights to and from Hargeisa. There are six major Somali-
owned and operated fleets.
Telecommunications Infrastructure
• A mobile phone penetration rate of only 45 percent
and fierce competition has led mobile network operators
to offer some of the world’s cheapest mobile
rates.
• The telecommunications industry invested heavily to
improve connectivity, with 3G and 4G already rolled
out across Somaliland. The port city of Berbera is to
be connected to the Eastern Africa Submarine Cable
System (EASSy), a medium of internet connectivity
carrying telecom traffic for all African operators
from the Eastern and Southern African markets to
connecting cable networks in Europe, Asia, and the
Americas.
• The telecommunications industry remains competitive
in the region as international calls made from
Somaliland are some of the cheapest in Africa. Somaliland
is also one of the most active mobile money
markets in the world, with 26 percent of subscribers
using mobile money to pay bills – one of the highest
user rates in the world.
• The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology
(MoICT) established a spectrum management
monitoring system for the first time. The spectrum
management system regulates radio frequency to
promote efficient service, mitigating radio spectrum
pollution and maximizing the benefit of usable radio
spectrum.
• In 2021 an innovation zone was launched. The main
objective of the innovation zone is to train public
servants, as the government transitions to providing
e-services and rolls out its digital transformation
strategy. The facility is expected to develop into an
e-learning, e-health, and e-commerce platform, and
supports a data exchange platform and capacity
building. It is expected, at later stages, to provide
advanced trainings on topics such as programming,
digital marketing, and cybersecurity.
• A significant development in early 2022 is the public-
private partnership with three leading telecommunication
providers agreeing to share the landing and
operation of submarine cables to enter the country.
Each telecommunication provider will own 31.67 percent
of the new joint company, while the government
will own five percent. Currently, a total of 1,200 km
of optic fibre cable has been laid and four out of six
regions are connected.
• Following the laying of foundations to reopen postal
services in the country, the international postal service
resumed in March 2019 following an agreement
with Djibouti. International post will be channelled
through the Djibouti Postal Agency (La Poste de Djibouti).
The Djibouti Postal Agency agreed to represent
Somaliland at all the regional and international
conferences that Somaliland cannot attend due to
lack of recognition.
9.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
• Improving the large physical infrastructure deficit
to support the population in different facets of their
lives. The land, sea, and air access routes need to
be strengthened for a more frequent, efficient, profitable,
and sustainable means of transport services.
• Strengthening the ICT infrastructure to support the
transformation of digital services. The expansion
of the fibre optic cable network and the provision
of quality and affordable internet services form the
cornerstones of this challenge.
• Strengthening physical planning, which will serve
as the catalyst to increased access to decent and
affordable housing with green and socio-environmentally
friendly surroundings.
•
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 54
• Reviewing and updating the legal and regulatory
framework in the infrastructure sector. A robust
regulatory framework will boost investor confidence,
delivering safer and better regulated and maintained
public and private infrastructure.
9.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: Expanding the building and adequate
maintenance of safe and sustainable transport, housing, and
ICT public infrastructure, according to the requirements of
the country.
Outcome 1: By 2027, transport services by land,
sea, and air are safer and more frequent, efficient,
profitable, and sustainable.
The Ministry of Transport and Roads Development will
contribute to this outcome through the following priority
interventions:
1. Having modern paved roads is critical for development.
A good, paved road has a positive impact on
fuel use efficiency, reduced vehicle maintenance
cost, and an overall increase in road safety, especially
with road signage. The MoTRD has identified the
following road networks as priorities to be paved in
the next five years:
• Lawyaddo-Fardaha-Borama road (270 km)
• Burao-Oodweyne-Hargeisa Road (190 km)
• Erigavo-Maydh (Tabca) road (78 km)
• Las’anood to Kalabaydh road (40 km)
• Borama-Baki Road (37 km)
• Berbera-Las-iidle Road
• Hargeisa-Salahley Road (71 km)
• Hargeisa – Balligubadle Road (65 km)
• Dhubato-Cadaadley Road (40 km)
In addition, the Wadamago-Qoralugud-Buhodle
Road (90 km) will be upgraded but remains unpaved.
2. Conducting a feasibility study, as part of the Berbera
Corridor development, for the Berbera-Hargeisa-
Aware-Shilabo railway, road, and natural gas pipeline.
Based on the findings of the study, a financing
mechanism will be determined.
3. Improving the coordination and management of
transport services in Somaliland. The issuing of vehicle
circulation books and driving licenses will be
decentralised to the regional level.
4. Establishing policies and guidelines related to providing
government transport services and vehicles, their
effective management, and improved coordination.
5. Registering all maritime vessels operating in the
country as well as the licensing of skippers.
Furthermore, the Civil Aviation and Airports Authority will
contribute to this outcome through the following priority
interventions:
1. Upgrading the Hargeisa Airport, which serves as the
main entry port but has limited facilities that need
updating. A new tower and flight information centre
will be built, supported by a runway lighting system
to improve air navigation and safety.
2. Improving domestic aviation and overall connectivity
by air, a runway and terminal will be built at Burao
and Erigavo airports.
3. Conducting feasibility studies of Las’anood Airport,
Borama Airport, and Kalabaydh Airport to consider
airport expansions to other cities. Pursuant to the
findings of the study, a master plan will be developed
on overall airport developments in the country.
4. Developing a national air transport policy to build the
foundations of a thriving aviation industry in consultation
with industry players. The policy will guide the
airspace management systems and facilities needed.
Following the policy, all existing rules and regulations
will be reviewed and updated to conform to IATA and
ICAO standards. All airport operation and security
manuals will then be updated accordingly.
5. Establishing an aviation academy to support the education
and training of national aviation professionals.
Outcome 2: By 2027, a more widely available robust
ICT Infrastructure resulted in an expansion of quality
internet-based e-services.
The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology
will achieve this outcome through the following priority
interventions:
1. Expanding universal access to ICT services through
various mechanisms, including promoting and establishing
incubators, innovation, parks, and ICT training
centres. The government will also create and register
one or more top level domains.
2. Accelerating digitalisation of its services (e.g., e-procurement)
with secured networks by building off
existing and expanded optic fibre cable networks.
To improve on efficiency, a national data centre will
be established to host all data related to government
e-services and others. The secured, fast, and reliable
internet will also be a catalyst for the development of
private sector services and to expand online education
through e-learning platforms and systems.
3. Developing the required policies, laws, and regulations
for interconnectivity. Interconnection is the nucleus
of modern telecommunications, be it internet
service providers or mobile telephone operators. To
realize the full potential of telecommunications in
the economy, interconnectivity between operators is
key.
4. Establishing and reinforcing postal and delivery
structures to ensure Somaliland has the necessary
structures for local and international postal service
delivery and related services. The traditional role
of the postal service has been expanded to include
other emerging services. Whereas the traditional
sending of letters has dwindled worldwide, parcel
delivery services have boomed, in part because of
e-commerce. An important step will be the inclusion
of all regions in a GIS based address system, making
it easier for smaller private sector operators to step
into niche markets.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 55
Outcome 3: By 2027, improved physical planning has
led to increased access to decent and affordable
housing with green and socio-environmentally
friendly surroundings.
The Ministry of Public Works, Land and Housing will achieve
this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Integrating spatial planning into urban development
in Somaliland. The MoPWLH recognises that the
development of urban centres needs to be guided
by spatial plans, considering public services and infrastructure,
economic activities, and environmental
concerns. A basic urban planning manual was developed
in 2010 with technical support by UN-Habitat.
The MoPWLH intends to develop a national spatial
development plan, six integrated urban development
plans, and 23 spatial master plans for electoral districts.
Besides being important safeguards for future
developments in the country and large population
centres, these spatial plans are also instruments
that can play a role as part of a finance mobilisation
strategy.
2. Conducting research on low-cost housing, building
materials, and technologies to maximise the benefits
of using scarce resources. Decent and affordable
housing (shelter) is a basic human right and the
government is committed to providing a facilitating
environment.
3. Creating a national housing database which will feed
into policies on housing allocation, amongst others.
Relatedly, civil engineers at all levels of government
administration will be trained on surveying using
Geographic Information System technolog. The
increased capacity within both central and local government
will then be utilised to develop and maintain
an efficient land information system.
4. Providing housing for government employees. The
ministry expects to oversee the design and construction
of 600 new housing units and the rehabilitation
and maintenance for another 500 existing units.
5. With respect to additional public infrastructure, the

GOVERNANCE SECTOR
Chapter 10
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 58
10.1 Introduction
Good governance is critical for economic, political, environmental,
and social development. It directly concerns
management of the development process, involving all
stakeholders. Functional democracy, with strong public
participation, is a crucial element in governance as it promotes
sustainable development policies and programmes.
Accountability is a fundamental pillar in a democratic institution.
For this reason, public resource governance is the
broad objective when pursuing proper management of the
human, financial, and material resources of a country.
A secure environment is a pre-condition for sustainable
socioeconomic development. This involves ensuring the
safety and security of citizens and property. Effective rule
of law ensures that the justice system is resolving disputes
in an appropriate manner, protecting citizens’ rights, and
ensuring equal access to public services and due process.
Democratic governance is based on the rule of law and
respect for human rights, and contributes to long-term,
sustainable economic and social development. Diplomatic
and international cooperation and engagement are extremely
difficult for an unrecognised polity. Achieving de
jure recognition remains the ultimate goal for Somaliland,
so that Somaliland becomes a fully-fledged member of the
international community.
10.2 Situational Analysis
Policies and Legal Reforms
Knowing the importance of the legal and policy frameworks,
and of complying with the related regulations, the
Ministry of Interior was instrumental in the formulation and
enactment of the following laws and policies that are being
implemented:
• Decentralisation Policy and Expansion Strategy
• Lands Management Policy 2017
• Ministry of Interior Human Resource Strategy
• Amendments and supplements to the Anti-Narcotics
law, Law No. 21-2021
• Amendments and supplements to the Police Force
Act, Law No. 63-2013
• Amendments and supplements to the Autonomous
Regions and Districts Law, Law No. 23-2019
• Money Laundering Prevention Act. Law No. 87-2019
• Somaliland Urban Waste Management and Sanitation
Law No. 83-2018
• Somaliland Coast Guard Act 2018
• Airport Security Duties Act No. 61-2013
• Code of Conduct and Public Safety Law. 51/2012
• Anti-Piracy Law. 52/2012
• Small Arms Control Act Polit Law No. 32/2010
• Citizenship Act. 22/2002
• Urban Land Management Act Exc. Law No. 17-2001
Progress in terms of the legal and policy front includes:
• Replacing the Police Law No. 63/2013 (2017) with a
consolidated Somaliland Police Force (amendments
and additions) Law (No. 63/2013, 2019)
• Police regulations are under process to ensure the
efficient operability of the police law
• A police strategic plan has been drafted to promote
an effective, efficient, professional, and accountable
police force
• Sector ministries completed the review of legal
gaps that need to be addressed to expand the local
government’s responsibilities in service delivery in
education, health, and water, and forwarded these to
the IMC for review
• A by-law requesting all districts to implement participatory
planning and accountability reporting
Security
Various security entities are involved in this sector. Their
working relationship, the level of their coordination, and the
synergy of their activities are key for sustainable security.
Ministry of Interior (MoI)
The MoI is the chair of the security sub-sector and membership
includes all law enforcement agencies.
To reduce possession and counter the availability and trafficking
of small arms and light weapons, the MoI continued
with the registration of small arms and light weapons in an
improved small arms registration system.
Security is a factor to be considered in elections in all
circumstances. Due to election related risk, the MoI conducted
risk assessments before the combined elections
of the parliamentary and local councils to ensure that the
elections were conducted in a peaceful environment. The
MoI worked closely with the commanders of the security
agencies to supervise and coordinate the overall security
of combined elections of the parliamentary and local council
elections in 2021.
Inter-clan conflict over revenge killings, land, and water
disputes remains an internal security challenge in Somaliland.
The MoI devoted considerable resources and time in
resolving or mitigating inter-clan conflicts. The MoI has successfully
resolved prolonged clan-conflicts of Cel-Afwayn
and Fadhi Gab in the eastern regions.
To make police services available to all the people in Somaliland
in a democratic manner, reflecting respect for the
Somaliland constitution and laws, the Somaliland Police
Force Reform Policy was implemented. As a result, there
was an improvement in police service to the public. In addition,
amendments and additions to the Police Force Act
were written in 2019.
Regional security cooperation and integration are crucial
for Somaliland, both politically and economically. In this
context, the Counter Piracy Coordination (CPC) Office had
more engagements, collaboration, and cooperation with
international and regional maritime forums by attending
meetings and conferences concerning maritime security of
the Western Indian Ocean, the Gulf of Aden, and the Red
Sea in the past five years. The CPC Office continued to
share and receive information on maritime security with national
and international agencies to prevent piracy threats
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 59
in the coastal waters of Somaliland.
Police Force
The Somaliland Police Force (SLPF) has grown over the
years into a functioning force that keeps relative peace,
maintains high levels of personal commitment, and closely
works with communities along with their traditional leaders
to resolve disputes and render justice. Furthermore,
the SLPF enjoys a level of public recognition and support
across Somaliland’s communities. The Police Academy
was established in 2020, along with the Mandheera Police
Training School, to provide training to enhance the performance
of the SLPF.
A notable successful operation for the Somaliland police,
in cooperation with other security institutions, was for the
2021 election. More than ten thousand police officers were
deployed during voting registration and election process
(pre-election, during the election, and post-election).
The police made notable progress in the following areas:
• Community policing, counterterrorism
• Riot control
• Training in various fields
• Construction of over 30 police stations
• Modernising communication systems
• Improving criminal investigation capabilities
• Recruitment of police officers from the National Service
Program
To have both short and long-term capacity-building interventions
for the police forces, a training needs assessment
was conducted. Similarly, to measure the capacity of the
police force to counter and combat the ongoing terrorist
threat, a counter-terrorism assessment was commissioned
by the SLPF.
Coast Guard
The Somaliland Coastguard (SLCG) was established in
1995 as part of the Somaliland National Armed Forces. The
long coastline is divided into four sectors, which consist
of Berbera, Maydh, Zeila, and Laqoray. Each sector has
several observation posts, with a total of twelve along the
coastline.
Protecting and guarding the 850 km coastline is a significant
task for the SLCG. Capacity-building support and improvements
in infrastructure and equipment that are critical
for coastal security were provided to the SLCG. As such,
the capacity of the Somaliland Coastguard was enhanced,
allowing them to actively patrol the sea to prevent illegal
fishing, smuggling, and piracy, in addition to providing training
to newly recruited officers.
An advanced communication system for the coastguard
was established for communication between sea stations
and headquarters, along with the installation of an AXIOM
international database system. Improvements were also
made to maritime infrastructure and facilities.
Immigration and Border Control
The Somaliland Immigration and Border Control (SIBC) has
made a considerable effort to protect the borders from the
illegal movement of people, weapons, drugs, and contraband
while striving to promote lawful entry and exit. During
the COVID-19 pandemic, the SIBC introduced COVID-19
guidelines for those entering and leaving the country.
Capacity-building support was provided to the SIBC to improve
their capability to meet their mandates and responsibilities.
Assistance offered to the SIBC includes:
• Establishing telecommunication channels
• Installing solar systems at Wajale, Lowyo’addo, and
Berbera immigration offices
• Building the Immigration Training Academy (Haleeya)
• Establishing an information management system at
the border entry and main offices
• Recruiting more officers and staff
The Fire Brigade
The National Fire Brigade was not included in NDP II. However,
the following are some of their achievements since
they were established:
• Setting up an emergency 24/7 call centre
• Rescuing 577 people from dangerous situations
• Saving financial assets, with an estimated value of
US$ 9,927,729
• Saving a total of 439 animals and 223 vehicles from
dangerous situations
Ministry of Defence (MoD)
A functional review of the MoD was carried out. As a result
of the functional review, additional departments were
established: Policy & Planning, Mine Action, Pensions &
Welfare, Public Communications, and Disarmament, Demobilisation,
and Reintegration (DDR).
Knowing the dangers associated with land mines and their
effect on people’s lives and movements, the MoD undertook
various interventions to mitigate this threat. These activities
include clearing land mines in most of Somaliland’s
regions. Furthermore, the MoD conducted an awareness
campaign on the threats and hazards of land mines in most
of Somaliland’s regions.
The National Army, in its role to defend the country and
preserve its territorial integrity, undertook military security
operations in eastern Somaliland, countering hostile forces.
It also actively participated in intervening in clan-based
conflicts, election security, the response to COVID-19, and
distributing relief aid to famine and drought-stricken areas.
Other notable achievements of the National Army are recruiting
female officers and soldiers for the first time and
the passage of the Military Pension Law by Parliament in
2019.
Democratisation and Decentralisation
In the case of Somaliland, democratisation and decentralisation
are seen as effective models of governance that can
contribute to sustainable peace and prosperity. Since the
introduction of multi-party democracy in 2002, Somaliland
made notable progress on democratisation and decentralisation,
and it is imperative to build on these successes to
further consolidate gains. Somaliland’s National Electoral
Commission (NEC) organised elections in 2021. The NEC
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 60
also attained a certain level of cohesion and discipline,
gaining them trust and confidence from political parties and
the general public.
Elections in Somaliland largely depend on external funding.
However, recently, the share of the international financing
in the electoral process has declined. In that context, the
government of Somaliland is increasingly providing the
lion’s share of election expenditure. In the 2015 presidential
elections, the government covered over 50 percent of
election costs. Subsequently, in the combined parliamentary
and local council elections in 2021, the government
covered more than 70 percent of the costs.
A consolidated law covering the president, the House of
Representatives, and local council elections, as well as the
Voter Registration Act, was passed in 2020 and became
known as the General National Elections and Voter Registration
Law (Law No. 19/2020).
The Ministry of Constitutional Affairs (MoCA) has also organised
several activities to educate young people and
the public on the Somaliland constitution to prepare them
for citizenship and to take part in civic life. These activities
include:
• Awareness-raising campaigns on the Somaliland
constitution across the country for 34,500 people,
comprising of civil servants, police, security departments,
and the general public. These civic education
campaigns were disseminated through national television,
radio, social media networks, private media,
and the website of the MoCA.
• More than 60,000 copies of the Somaliland constitution
were distributed to communities, the first time
that a paper copy of the constitution was made available
to the public. Moreover, 3,000 young people
in Somaliland learned about the Constitution of Somaliland
and citizenship via a centre for constitution
and civic education. The centre provided courses on
the constitution and citizenship to national service
students from 2019 to 2021 under a civic education
programme on election processes called “Responsible
Citizens”.
• Many provisions in the constitution end with the
phrase “shall be determined by a special law” and
most of these special laws are still pending. In this
context, the MoC conducted an assessment survey
on Somaliland’s constitution to identify outstanding
“special laws".
Decentralisation
The MoI is responsible for the implementation of the Somaliland
decentralisation process. The MoF, MoE, MoH,
and MoW work along with the MoI to realise political,
administrative, and fiscal decentralisation. The role of the
MoI and these ministries is to initiate and formulate regulations,
policies, and strategies, as well as provide technical
support to and monitoring of the implementation process.
Local governments, on the other hand, are responsible for
implementing national policies and strategies through local
development plans, taking into consideration their unique
local needs, priorities, and resources. In recent years, improvements
in the financial and accounting policies and
procedures of local governments have increased their
revenue base. This has enhanced the ability of the councils
to deliver basic services to the citizenry. In line with the
broader Public Finance Management Strategy, basic public
finance management systems were introduced in seven
districts, which improved the efficiency and transparency
of local governments’ public resource management. Four
of these systems are linked to the central government’s
public finance systems to improve the accuracy and timeliness
of the financial reports of both the central and local
governments.
More than ten districts have District Development Frameworks
(DDFs), which are five-year plans that identify the
basic needs and priorities of these districts, their local economic
opportunities, and contain a scoping of its natural
resources. The consultative process of producing the DDFs
has enhanced the capacity of the planning departments in
those local governments in terms of creating participatory
development plans. Another benefit of the public consultations
is that they have strengthened the relationship
between local governments and the public, local leaders,
civic groups, and international agencies. To ensure the
implementation of these development plans, the MoI developed
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) tools to monitor
local government activities.
Under the first decentralisation policy (2013-2020) in 2014,
the Somaliland government and the UN Joint Programme
on Local Governance (JPLG) piloted a service delivery
programme in three districts, which assumed limited responsibilities
in the education, health, and water sectors.
In 2021, under the JPLG Programme, eight districts undertook
specific responsibilities in the provision of education
and health service, such as paying the salaries of security
personnel and cleaning staff for primary health facilities
and schools. In partnership with the JPLG, INGOs, and
the public, local governments undertook the construction,
expansion, or rehabilitation of roads, primary schools, and
maternal and paediatric health clinics.
An awareness campaign was developed to improve the
understanding of local officials and the public about the
decentralisation policy and its time frame, the role of the
Boundary Commission, and the periods of the local council
elections.
A Local Government Institute (LGI) was established in 2018
to enhance the capacity of local government civil servants.
Since then, the LGI has provided short and long-term training
courses to improve the skills and competence of local
governments’ civil servants. Moreover, during the 2021
local government election, the MoI carried out induction
training for all the newly elected councillors on i) the roles
and responsibilities in law 23, ii) decentralisation and local
governance and their relevance for local council development,
and iii) the computerised financial system for all
electoral districts.
Rule of Law and Human Rights
Somaliland continues to recognise the importance of promoting
the rule of law to achieve these development goals.
This sub-sector covers rule of law and human rights and the
institutions that are responsible to administer, manage and
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 61
ensure fair access to justice equitably through the protection
and promotion of human rights.
Justice
The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) of Somaliland, which was established
in 1997 under Act 81/96, promotes justice and the
rule of law. Since its establishment there has been steady
progress in the functionality of the judicial and rule of law
systems that include the following achievements:
• Reforms of existing legislation, regulations, and legal
codes
• Expanding the court systems, penitentiary facilities,
and law enforcement services, particularly in the
urban centres
• Improvement in public trust in and utilisation of the
formal justice system
To expand the justice service to rural areas, Alternative
Dispute Resolution (ADR) Centres were established in four
regions (Maroodi Jeh, Sool, Sanaag, and Togdher). ADR
centres link the traditional means for dispute resolution
with the formal justice systems, as a majority of the people
in Somaliland continue to rely on customary law
Educational and vocational training has been provided to
the inmates of four prisons. The number of male inmates
who received such education and training was 314. Out
of that number, 132 inmates finished their coursework in
late 2020. In 2022, a vocational training programme was
established in the Gabiley Female Prison. So far, 30 female
inmates benefited from this programme, which is expected
to continue into 2023.
Since 2018, at least 20 officers were trained in prison
management each year and then deployed in different jails
and other facilities in the country. In addition, 80 female
custodial corps officers were trained in 2021 and 2022 in
prison management and the protection of the human rights
of inmates. To improve prison conditions, several prisons
were either built or rehabilitated:
• The following prisons were newly constructed: The
Baki, Odwayne, Burao, and Borama prisons, a new
prison in Hargeisa, and the Juvenile Rehabilitation
Centre in Geel Lowkor in the Sahil region
• The following were rehabilitated and expanded: Gabiley,
Hargeisa, Mandera, and Berbera prisons.
Human Rights
The Somaliland National Human Rights Commission (SLNHRC)
is a statutory body established by an act of parliament
(Law No. 39/2010) entitled “The Somaliland National
Human Rights Commission Act”. The act was entered into
force in December 2010 and identifies the establishment of
the SLNHRC, its broad mandate, functions, and institutional
structure. Since its inception, the SLNHRC has taken the
following interventions:
• Improving human rights education
• Monitoring of detainees and detention centres for
the protection and promotion of basic human rights
• Enhancing the rights of vulnerable people through
periodic assessments and reporting on their situations
• Advocating for the freedom of expression and due
process
• Training of 300 law enforcement officers on human
rights and in specific areas such as observing and respecting
freedom of expression rights, due process,
and the fundamental human rights enshrined in the
Constitution
• Supporting 450 people who complained about human
rights violations through counselling, mediation,
and referring them to related agencies
• Opening offices in Awdal, Sahil, Burao, Las Anod,
and Erigavo to expand the work of the SLNHRC
• Securing the release of 30 detainees, in cooperation
with other rights actors
• Publishing the annual report on the human rights
situation in the country since 2017
Parliamentary Relations and Constitutional
Affairs
The Ministry of Parliamentary Relations and Constitutional
Affairs (MoPCA) was established in 1995 by presidential
decree No. 59/95.
MoPCA has conducted studies and assessments on several
issues and topics during the NDP II period related to the
rule of the law:
• A study of the penal code and public opinion
• A study on Islamic jurisprudence
• A study on adultery in the Islamic context
• A study on stealing and Islamic view on this issue
• A study on the Islamic view of imprisonment
• Research on the penal code
Similarly, the MoPCA has reviewed Somaliland’s Criminal
Law and Civil Law to update them and make them more
comprehensive.
Public Resource Management
Several institutions are tasked with different facets of public
resource management whose interventions should lead
to better opportunities for all Somalilanders.
Finance and Accountability (MoFD, NAO, NTB)
The Ministry of Finance Development (MoFD) ensures, with
good public finance management principles, accountability
for all revenue and expenditures of the state. The second
Public Finance Management Reform Programme (PFM
Programme) was launched and aims to build on the first
programme. Through the Budget Committee, the PFM
Programme ensures both internal controls and budget
allocations anchored in the NDP as well as Vision 2030.
A fundamental part of public finance management is procurement,
which is handled by the National Tender Board,
a central procurement authority for all major purchases of
public goods and services. All these processes are then
subjected to an independent external audit by the National
Audit Office. The National Audit Office is tasked with ensuring
value for money for government. These processes
by different institutions are geared towards accountability
and probity.
The reforms under the first PFM Programme improved
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 62
the budget calendar, management, financial controls, and
financial reporting mechanisms of the Government of Somaliland.
This includes, among other things, the national
budget policy and processes, including fiscal transfers to
the local authorities.
The Budget Policy Committee, chaired by the MoPND, has
improved transparency and equity in the national planning
and budgeting process, ensuring that annual budgets are
aligned with the overall National Plans and communities
are engaged in the process. To better inform the public
about government expenditures, the budget classification
now uses the Classification of Functions of Government
(COFOG) international standards.
For a more transparent procurement process, a National
Tender Board Act was enacted to ensure value for money.
The authority has started working on several policy issues,
such as the Public Procurement Policy, regulations for public
procurement, and an overall strategy for the NTB, which
will steer the direction of procurement in the country.
The Civil Service
The human resources of any country are its most important
factor for development. Somaliland’s civil servants
are recruited by the Civil Service Commission (CSC) and
supported, through lifelong learning, by the Civil Service
Institute (CSI). The broad objective is to provide all Somalilanders
the opportunity to serve the country. This should
be achieved through a more merit-based recruitment and
promotion system.
The CSC, through the CSI, supports the capacity development
of civil servants in different disciplines. It also develops
internal policies and strategies geared towards a more
effective civil service. The payment and grading policy
are being developed, as well as the civil service pension
scheme. The civil service law was amended, and a five-year
strategic plan was approved, guiding the recruitment and
development of civil servants.
Good Governance
Somaliland’s institutions must comply with the ethos of
good governance, which forms the bedrock of effective
development. This is administered by the Somaliland Good
Governance Commission (GGC), which is responsible for
creating and maintaining a culture of good governance and
a system of public administration that is free from mismanagement
and corruption. The GGC carried out the following
activities:
• Developing and implementing public awareness
campaigns on corruption and its impact on society
and the economy
• Promoting coordination and collaboration of public
institutions regarding accountability and transparency
• Prioritising the clarification and separation of certain
government institutional mandates to prevent confliction
Improving Standards
A quality control laboratory was established in Berbera in
2022 for testing drugs and cosmetics with investments
through the national budget. A food laboratory was also
established in Berbera. Before 2022, Somaliland lacked
the required quality infrastructure mechanisms to check
the quality of imported goods.
The National Quality Control Commission (NQCC) created
technical committees, which are comprised of members
from academia, the business community, local industries,
independent experts, and consumers. They developed 24
standards in total.
Somaliland National Printing
The National Printing Agency (NPA) is mandated for state
printing, both for accountability and ensuring the security
of government information. For this reason, the Gazette
and other government publications are mandatory to be
printed by the NPA. However, there has been a low level of
utilisation of the NPA.
The Government of Somaliland invested over US$1 million
in the printing agency, which was used to construct a new
building and purchase new printing machines to help take
on more sophisticated tasks. Over the NDP II period, the
NPA started printing the road tax sticker and Somaliland
Central Bank cheques.
Foreign Relations and International
Cooperation
On the diplomatic front, Somaliland organised missions
to the UK and US to promote the strategic position of Somaliland
and its quest for international recognition. Some
outcomes include:
• Winning the support of some UK MPs, which led to
the UK Parliament debating the case of recognition
of Somaliland on 18 January 2022
• Cultivating support in the US Congress that led to
the visit of some US Congressional delegations to
Somaliland to increase US engagement directly with
Somaliland
• The US Congress-Somaliland Partnership Act to
counter Chinese influence in the region
• Engaging with the international community - Somaliland
has mission offices in Ethiopia, Djibouti, Kenya,
the UAE, Yemen, the UK, USA, and Germany, among
others
10.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
Ministry of Interior
• Formulating an institutional development strategy
for the MoI, detailing the organogram of the MoI
with clear management structures, and improving
the working space of needed human resources as
required by the strategy.

EDUCATION SECTOR
Chapter 11
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 73
11.1 Introduction
The right to education, as enshrined in Article 21 of the UN
Charter on Human Rights, affirms the ultimate obligation of
all states to provide education to its citizens as a fundamental
human right, especially free education in the elementary
and fundamental stages. Somaliland’s Vision 2030 envisages
that education will be among the fundamental pillars
on which the modern knowledge society will be built. The
government reaffirms its commitment in always providing
accessible and quality education.
Education and training provide equality of opportunities for
individuals to participate in local and national development.
The overall education strategy is to improve access to quality
education and training within a holistic approach. There
are policies, acts, and related regulations which guide the
sector towards achieving these objectives, yet the policy
and legal frameworks at times still need strengthening.
There are also many non-government providers of education
and training at all levels, such as non-governmental organisations
(NGOs), charity-based organisations (ChBOs),
and community-based organisations (CBOs). The contribution
of these partners in the sector has been immense.
Quranic schools, under the Ministry of Endowment and Religious
Affairs, are an important pillar of religious education
in Somaliland.
Moving forward, the education sector, during the plan period
of 2022-2026 will have a broad strategic thrust that
aspires to both vertical and horizontal development of the
sector in improving access, affordability, and quality to better
serve the development needs of the population and the
country alike.
11.2 Situational Analysis
The Ministry of Education and Science (MoES) successfully
implemented the Education Sector Strategy over the last
five years (2017-2021), and the formulation of the next Sector
Strategy, exactly coinciding with the NDP III period, is in
its approval stage.
The Education Sector Situational Analysis of 2021 confirmed
that progress has been achieved in the key areas
of access, equity, and quality across all sub-sectors of education.
In addition, gains have been made in governance,
administration, planning, human resources, infrastructure,
and finance, as well as in other key institutional structures
that support education delivery. As access to education is
closely linked to the expansion of available appropriate
infrastructure, they are jointly presented below.
Early Childhood Education
Access to ECE and Infrastructure
There are currently 263 pre-primary schools across Somaliland,
serving an estimated Early Childhood Education (ECE)
population of approximately 265,000 four- to five-yearolds.
In the past five years, 26 public pre-primary schools
have been constructed and furnished, of which 15 are managed
by the Pharo Foundation on behalf of the MoES. The
Gross Enrolment Rate (GER) has increased slightly over the
past five years to 1.25 percent, or 3,037 students. About 1.7
percent of children in ECE are over pre-primary age.
Equity in Early Childhood Education
Formal pre-primary education is predominantly an urban
phenomenon. Quranic schools have the highest coverage
in both urban and rural areas.
Primary Education
Access to Primary Education and Infrastructure
Since 2016, the number of primary schools rose from 1,145
in 2015/2016 to 1,240 schools in 2020/2021, representing
an 8.3 percent increase. Primary education enrolment
has grown from 255,716 in 2015/16 to 280,561 in 2021,
representing an increase of 9.7 percent. Primary education
improvements also include revisions of textbooks and improving
textbook availability and accessibility.
Due to continuous efforts to increase enrolments, the
primary education GER has increased from 29 percent in
2018/19 to 32 percent in 2020/21, representing an increase
of 3 percent. Nevertheless, this means that only just over
3 out of every 10 children of primary school age are in fact
attending primary school.
As the availability of classrooms is one of the major constraints
to drastically increasing enrolment, immense efforts
in building new infrastructure are needed during the NDP III
period to ensure a substantial increase in the GER.
Equity Aspects of Primary Education
Efforts have been made to improve equity, and as a result
more girls and other children from vulnerable groups, such
as children with special education needs (SEN), refugee
children, and nomadic children have enrolled in basic education.
However, this has not translated to an improved
Gender Parity Index (GPI), which is the ratio of female to
male enrolment. The NDP II target of a GPI of 0.94 in 2021
has not been achieved, with the primary education GPI
decreasing from 0.89 in 2015/16 to 0.81 in 2020/21. These
efforts need to be increased considerably during the NDP
III period. In this context, it is important to note that in the
academic year 2020/21 only 19 percent of primary school
teachers were female.
Children with special needs’ access to primary education
has moved from 0.46 percent in 2015/16 to 1.78 percent in
2018/19, before falling to 0.8 percent in 2020/21. It was estimated
that there were 1,179 children with special needs in
primary schools in the 2015/16 academic year, of which 45
percent were female. This rose to 2,777 (45 percent female)
in 2018/19, before falling to 2,453 in the 2020/21 academic
year.
The number of refugee children accessing mainstream
primary education increased from 1,412 in 2015/16 to 1,855
(51 percent female) in 2020/21.
Quality Aspects of Primary Education
There have been improvements in primary education
teacher development and management. The Somaliland
National College of Teacher Education (SLNCTE) has been
established and is functional. As of 2021 the College graduated
and certified approximately 229 pre-service qualified
teachers. Primary teachers have benefited from training
that focused on child friendly spaces, early childhood trainRepublic
of Somaliland National Development Plan III 74
ing, school-based mentoring, and early grade literacy and
numeracy.
The number of primary teachers increased from 7,819 in
2015/16 to 9,206 in 2018/19 before reducing to 8,977 in
2020/21. A total of 1,820 unqualified teachers who are
currently serving government schools are undergoing
training to upgrade their knowledge and pedagogical skills
at SLNCTE. Teachers who complete the two-year in-service
programme and pass the subsequent teacher examinations
will be awarded a diploma in Primary Education. This
qualification will allow them to be registered as qualified
and certified teachers.
The national average “pupil-to-qualified-teacher” ratio has
improved from 47 down to 40, although there are still considerable
variations between rural and urban areas.
The primary schools’ “pupil-to-textbook” ratio has also
improved from 2.9 in 2015/16 to 2.5 in 2020/21. However,
there are noticeable disparities between rural and urban
areas, as well as between public and private schools.
The latest Education Management Information System
(EMIS) data of 2020/21 indicates that a low primary education
repetition rate of 1.3 percent (1.4 percent female) has
been achieved and a low primary education dropout rate of
3.5 percent (3.9 percent female) has been attained. A high
retention rate of 89 percent from grades one to five has
been attained and a good primary average promotion rate
of 95.5 percent has been attained as well.
Secondary Education
Access to Secondary Education and
Infrastructure
During the NDP II period, the number of secondary schools
increased by 28 percent, from 164 in 2015/16 to 210 in
2020/21, while the absolute number of children enrolled
in secondary education in this period went up from 51,011
to 66,170 in 2020/21, representing a 29.7 percent increase
(Somaliland in Figures, 2014 and Education Statistics Yearbook,
2020-2021). It is not surprising that there is a straightforward
positive correlation between the proportional
increase in infrastructure and the proportional increase in
enrolments, meaning that any ambition to increase the GER
in education must be accompanied by a similar ambition in
increasing funds for infrastructural development.
It is also noteworthy that the growth in secondary school
enrolments surpassed population growth, and as a result,
the GER of Secondary Education increased from 14.5 percent
in 2015/16 to 16 percent in 2020/21.
Equity Aspects of Secondary Education
The number of children with disabilities enrolled in secondary
education has reduced from 659 in 2015/16 to 357 in
2020/21. This represents a reduction of 302 children, or
55 percent, which is of concern. As opposed to primary
education (see above), the GPI of secondary education has
increased from 0.68 in 2015/16 to 0.78 in the 2020/21 academic
year, representing a 0.1 increase and only narrowly
missing the Education Sector Strategic Plan (ESSP) target
of 0.8.
The percentage of female secondary teachers has increased
from two percent (80) in 2015/16 to 7.5 percent
(172) in 2018/19 before steeply declining to 3.7 percent (90)
in 2020/21. The ESSP target of eight percent has not been
achieved.
Quality Aspects of Secondary Education
Overall, the number of secondary school teachers has increased
from 1,958 in 2015/16 to 2,257 in 2020/21. This represents
an increase of 299 teachers, or 15 percent, which is
only half of the proportional increase in enrolment and new
infrastructure, and the availability of qualified teachers may
therefore become a growing bottleneck, possibly leading
to a negative impact on class size.
The national secondary schools’ Pupil-Teacher Ratio (PTR)
has increased from 26:1 in 2015/16 to 30:1 in 2020/21. This
ratio masks likely disparities between schools situated in
urban and rural areas.
The national secondary school’s Pupil-Classroom Ratio
(PCR) has increased from 42.2 in 2015/16 to 48 in 2020/21,
representing an increase of 5.8 children. The official MoES
secondary school PCR is 45 children in a classroom of 9 m
x 8 m.
In secondary school ten different subjects are taught, and
each student is therefore supposed to receive the ten
books for his/her form, or an ideal Pupil-Textbook Ratio of
10:1. However, the MoES reports in the 2020/21 Statistics
Yearbook a Pupil-Textbook Ratio of 2:1 in government
schools. Private secondary schools (83 out of 210) rely
mostly on student-owned textbooks. The availability of
properly equipped laboratories and libraries is also a key
concern in most secondary schools.
A low repetition rate of 1.1 percent has been achieved in
secondary education, as well as a low national average
dropout rate of 4.15 percent (5.3 percent for girls). There is
a relatively good transition rate of 94 percent from form two
to form three, i.e., from lower secondary to upper secondary
school. There has also been a good average secondary
promotion rate of 94 percent across all forms (one to four).
Non-formal Education
Alternative Basic Education
As stated earlier, about 70 percent of primary school age
children are not accessing formal primary education due
to a variety of reasons. Alternative Basic Education (ABE) is
a complementary initiative to bring formal basic education
services to marginalized children and those with diverse
needs to promote access to free basic education for all.
Enrolment figures from the 113 ABE schools show an
increase from 4,085 learners (44 percent female) in the
2015/16 academic year to 9,096 learners (51 percent female)
in 2020/21, or an increase of 122 percent. The ABE
curriculum has been reviewed and made outcome-based
in line with that of the formal primary education curriculum,
but there are concerns about rollout and implementation
practices, particularly as the number of ABE schools are
unknown and unregulated.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 75
Adult Learning
In 2021 there were a total of 55 Adult Learning Centres
(ALC) and 26 Family Life Education Centres (FLEC) with a
total of 9,136 enrolments (90 percent female).
A total of 15 FLECs and ALCs were renovated over the
course of NDP II. According to the 2018 Joint Review of
the Education Sector (JRES), 90 literacy and numeracy
non-formal education facilitators were trained on teaching
methods, educational psychology, measurement, and evaluation.
Technical Vocational Education and
Training (TVET)
Policy and Legal Reforms
The government, in collaboration with its partners, has
developed a comprehensive TVET policy, strategy, and
other guiding instruments such as a qualification framework,
occupational standards, operational manuals, and an
internship and employment policy. These instruments are
expected to improve the institutional and organisational
capacity of TVET stakeholders.
17 new TVET competency-based curricula for different
trades were developed during the period covered by the
ESSP for 2017-2021. There is a draft vocational qualification
framework in place which sets out the hierarchy of
qualifications. Under the new qualifications framework, a
strategy for prior experience/competence recognition and
certification is being developed. The Somaliland National
Education Board (SLNEB) has a functioning TVET Unit,
which sets, administers, and certifies all TVET exams, and
trainees that pass exams are also certified by the SLNEB.
Access to TVET and Infrastructure
Two new technical secondary schools were constructed in
Berbera and Beer, in addition to the already existing TVET
schools, namely the Hargeisa Technical Institute, the Burao
Technical Institute, and the TVET school at the Kuwait
Educational Complex. Countrywide TVET enrolment has
slightly increased from an estimated 5,000 in 2015/16 to
6,115 in 2021. TVET provisions are mainly free and provided
primarily by international NGOs.
Private TVET centres provide the bulk of technical and
vocational training. However, it is difficult to determine the
number of TVET centres and their trainees because registration
is not mandated. Most of these institutions are small
private enterprise-based businesses where trainees or
workers acquire skills on the job while earning small wages.
Overall, the 2018/19 EMIS data indicated that there were
53 TVET centres across all of the regions of Somaliland,
comprising mainly of government and NGO types.
Equity Aspects of TVET
TVET courses in Somaliland are largely separated by gender.
EMIS 2021 reports show that only male students participated
in mechanical, construction, welding, and plumbing
courses. Conversely, courses on tailoring and cooking
were largely comprised of female students.
Quality Aspects of TVET
Comprehensive criteria and admissions requirements for
the TVET programme are important to ensure that the
quality of graduates meet the ever-increasing demand for
skilled workers.
EMIS reports indicate that there are 393 qualified TVET
trainers. The MoES has created a functioning TVET Instructors
Training Unit, however there are no continuing professional
development opportunities for TVET instructors,
hampering career development.
All TVET courses offered between 2016 and 2021 were
popular in demand and led to high employment levels
after graduation. A TVET tracer study has shown that
84.6 percent of the vocational graduates were employed
or self-employed within 6 months after graduation. It is
worth mentioning that relevant TVET centres need to be
upgraded to a polytechnic level to substantially reduce the
dependence on foreign skilled teaching staff.
Higher Education
Access to Higher Education and Infrastructure
For the last two decades, the number of higher education
Institutions in Somaliland has risen from one university in
1998 to thirty-four universities in 2021, with only eight of
them being public. It is estimated that between 50,000 to
53,000 students are enrolled in higher education institutions.
The average annual intake of all universities is about
13,770. Review of university access figures indicates that
most learners are enrolled in private universities as compared
to the public universities.
Equity Aspects of Higher Education
Equity in higher education has improved with the provision
of scholarships to promising students from disadvantaged
backgrounds. At the beginning of every year, the government
provides 95 scholarships to needy first year students
who qualify to enrol in public universities. This scholarship
lasts until they complete their first degree. The government
also expects all universities to provide some scholarships
based on their overall intake of first-year students (eight
percent for public universities, six percent for private
universities, and ten percent for international universities
based in Somaliland). Overseas scholarships are provided
by Ethiopia (370 per year) and Taiwan (33 per year).
The gender balance in participation in higher education
has improved. It is estimated that in higher education institutions
located in big cities such as Hargeisa, Borama, and
Burco, the proportion of females is between 45 percent to
50 percent. In the institutions located in the other regions,
the share of female students ranges between 30 percent
to 37 percent. It should be noted, however, that universities
do not register the origin of their students in terms of urban
or rural. However, there are critical concerns about the low
number of female lecturers in both public and private universities,
estimated at two percent for the academic year
2020/21.
Quality Aspects of Higher Education
There is increased collaboration between the five public
universities in the areas of research and community engagement
programmes. Universities have strengthened
the quality of their courses by engaging more qualified
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 76
lecturers and by enhancing the professional and academic
development of their young graduates. There are also
concerns about funding, governance, access, equity, and
quality of education.
Institutional and Governance Aspects
Education Service Delivery Model
The decentralised Education Service Delivery Model (SDM)
has been piloted initially in Berbera, Burao, and Borama
since 2014. The Education SDM was rolled out in Gabiley
and Hargeisa in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The initiative
is now being rolled out in Zeylac, Odweyne, and Sheikh. A
Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the
MoES and the implementing partners (district councils).
The MoES has created Decentralised Education District
Committees (DEDC) in the 23 electoral districts. There are
currently 412 primary schools located in the districts who
are involved with rolling out the Education SDM.
Curriculum Development
The capacity of the National Curriculum Institute has been
built with the support of the MoES’ partners. The key
achievements are as follows:
• Development of a competence-based curriculum
framework in 2015, followed by the revision of the
primary education curriculum in 2015, and the curricula
for ABE in 2020 and ECE in 2021.
• The development of a pre-service teacher training
curriculum in 2019 and the in-service teacher training
curriculum in 2021.
Consequently, the Somaliland curriculum is widely used in
both public and private schools (pre-primary to secondary).
The estimated coverage was reported to be above 95
percent. Most stakeholders acknowledged that the new
curriculum meets the needs of the nation, community, and
learners, even as there is still scope for improvement.
Somaliland National College of Teacher
Education
The first phase of construction of the Somaliland National
College of Teacher Education was completed in 2016,
whilst the second phase is currently underway. The MoES
has deployed governance and administrative staff to the
College. The College continues to provide training to
teachers at all levels.
Education in Emergencies
The Education in Emergencies (EIE) cluster has clear functional
terms of reference for the provision of education in
emergency situations. Through these platforms, the MoES
has synergised and harmonised technical and financial resources
from partners to avoid overlap and duplication of
resources. The MoES has established district education development
committees to respond to and support schools
in coping during education emergency situations.
The ministry and its partners developed and implemented
the Education Cannot Wait (ECW) Multi-Year Resilience
Programme (MYRP), which is ongoing and covers much of
the emergency interventions in the education sector. Furthermore,
a comprehensive EIE contingency plan has been
developed and used for the past three years, and four EIE
assessments were conducted in the last two years.
The continuity of education during the peaks of COVID-19,
through recorded and broadcast lessons for primary, secondary,
and ABE, along with the integration of special sign
language curriculum, is testimony to the relevance of EIE.
Also:
• Conflict-affected area schools were rehabilitated, reopened,
and are now functional to provide learning.
• Teachers, headteachers, and Community Education
Committees (CEC) affected by community conflict
were provided psychosocial training.
• Remedial classes were established to recover lost
lessons resulting from community conflicts.
A joint drought response plan was developed by the ministry
and its partners to mitigate the impact of drought on
teaching and learning. In 2021 the droughts affected 103
schools in Sool, Sanaag, and Togdheer. These schools
received a three-month temporary feeding programme,
which improved child retention and wellbeing. The 103
schools also received water tanks to improve the capacity
of water storage, along with the provision of water trucking
for three months to maintain access to clean water.
Islamic Education
According to Somaliland in Figures (Nov. 2022), in 2020
there were 2,441 Quranic schools in Somaliland, with 7,195
teachers (25 percent female) and 192,970 students (43
percent female). The first unified curriculum for Quranic
schools was created in 2020, with a scheduled review
once every five years. With regards to Sharia institutes,
where Islamic scholars are educated, a mapping exercise
of existing syllabi took place in 2022, which resulted in an
estimation of the number of courses needed. The first unified
curriculum will be created in 2023. There are currently
93 Sharia institutes in the country.
11.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
• Increasing access to education and participation at
all education levels. Any serious attempts to increase
enrolment ratios must be accompanied in almost all
education levels by an equally ambitious matching
construction programme to increase infrastructural
capacity. In most levels of education, it must also be
accompanied by a matching drive to educate and
prepare enough quality teaching and management
staff.
• Persistent challenges in educational equity and
inclusion, especially for disadvantaged regions
and people such as nomads and IDPs. The drive to
increase the number of female students should be
accompanied by an increase in female teaching and
management staff as well, as their recruitment levels
are very low.
• Improving the quality of education at all levels, from
pre-primary school to higher education, remains an
important challenge for many years to come. Non-formal
education is meant to improve overall numeracy
and literacy skills in line with supporting livelihoods.
TVET education needs to be more demand-driven to
meet the skill set requirements of the job market.
• Improving overall institutional capacity in terms of
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 77
governance, management, and leadership capacity
to deliver quality education.
11.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: To achieve access for all to quality
education in soundly governed institutions, at all levels of
education and vocational training (as stated in the goals and
objectives of the ESSP, 2022-2026).
Outcome 1: By 2027, a significant increase in
educational access and participation will have been
achieved at all levels.
Pre-primary Education
The outcome target for the pre-primary education GER has
been set by the MoES to increase from five percent in 2021
to 20 percent in 2026. An increase of 15 percent of the
pre-primary school age population in 2026 (±307,000) is
approximately 46,000 children of four to five years old.
The Ministry of Education and Science will achieve this
through the following priority interventions:
1. Constructing and furnishing 50 new pre-primary
schools, each consisting of two classrooms and an
adequate playground and ensuring regional equity
and inclusivity of special education needs children
whilst continuing to operate the existing 31 public
pre-primary schools.
2. Introducing a two-year quality pre-primary education
that will realise the objectives of this level of education.
Plans will be in place to improve access and
participation in the programme for children.
3. Developing a comprehensive ECE advocacy and
fundraising strategy spearheaded by the MoES and
supported by partners.
4. Conducting comprehensive mapping of ECE
sub-sector provisions during the first year of ESSP
implementation and conducting a feasibility study to
explore ways of integrating different categories of
ECE provisions.
5. Integrating access to pre-primary education with
issues of school-based child protection, safety, and
nutrition.
Primary Education

Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 84
Observations
The education sector will, in line with international guidelines
and across all levels of education, continue to pursue
four main outcomes related to i) access, ii) equity and inclusion,
iii) quality and efficiency, and iv) improvements in
governance of the sector.
A summary of the cost estimates table is as follows:
• With regards to the cost of interventions at different
levels of education, primary education constitutes the
largest share with 45.6 percent of the total education
sector budget, followed by secondary education at
27.2 percent.
• Based on the indicated estimates, Outcome 4 on
governance and institutional capacity building is the
highest priority of the sector, as it is expected to have
an overall impact on all levels and other outcomes.
It represents 32 percent of the total sector budget,
followed by the budget on access to education and
quality and efficiency at 29 percent and 28 percent
respectively.
HEALTH SECTOR
Chapter 12
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 86
12.1 Introduction
A healthy nation is a wealthy nation. To improve the overall
outcomes of wellbeing and economic development, Somaliland
Vision 2030 aspires for a nation whose citizens
have equitable access to quality healthcare. This is paramount
as the nation, then and now, continues to grapple
with health challenges in terms of relatively high child
and maternal mortality, high mortality rates from preventable
diseases such as TB, as well as non-communicable
diseases. To achieve the objective of quality healthcare, a
combination of community health services and well-regulated
private healthcare, supported by a well-trained health
workforce, will be delivered to the citizens of Somaliland.
Despite continuous challenges, access to healthcare has
increased substantially over the years, largely thanks to the
collaboration between the government and its partners and
the invaluable role played by private healthcare providers.
The latter are especially more active in the urban areas.
Due to the disparity in health outcomes, the rural population
had priority focus during the last five years where
basic infrastructure that delivers essential health delivery
packages has been established. Newly constructed health
centres continue to operate in places where no other
health facilities had previously existed. District and regional
hospitals were upgraded to deliver better clinical services.
In addition, medical stores are operating in all six regions,
which contributed to improving quality and timely distribution
of essential supplies to all districts.
On human capital, as emphasised by Vision 2030, the total
health workforce has largely increased, yet significant disparities
among the regions and between urban and rural
areas remain. This is a major constraint in service delivery,
as an expanded health workforce could increase both the
access to and quality of services when the healthcare-worker-
to-patient ratio improves.
12.2 Situational Analysis
Policy and Legal Reforms
Several policy and legal instruments were approved and
enacted to improve health service delivery. These policies
will continue to guide the sector in the foreseeable future.
Key among these are:
• National Expanded Programme on Immunization
(EPI) Policy 2020
• National Health Policy 2021
• Mental Health Policy
• Nutrition Sub-sector Strategy 2019
• Health Sector Strategic Plan 2017-2021
The Essential Healthcare Package
Services (EHPS)
The EHPS policy aims to expand affordable essential health
services to improve overall health outcomes, including in
hard-to-reach areas, with a focus on vulnerable segments
of the population, particularly mothers, children, and people
with low socioeconomic status. Currently, the Ministry
of Health Development (MoHD), in conjunction with partner
organisations, provides highly subsidized primary healthcare
services in every district of the country. MoHD also
focused on improving service quality at the secondary
healthcare level that is provided at district or regional
hospitals. The emphasis is on ensuring that every citizen
can access affordable and quality secondary healthcare
services throughout the country.
Maternal and Child Mortality
Maternal mortality was considerably reduced from 732
deaths per 100,000 live births in 2017 to 396 deaths per
100,000 live births in 2020 (SLHDS 2020), slightly surpassing
the ambitious NDP II target of 400. Over the last
five years, a considerable reduction of infant mortality and
under-five mortality was also observed, coming down from
85 per 1,000 live births to 72 per 1,000 live births and 137
per 1,000 live births to 91 per 1,000 live births respectively.
The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) among women in Somaliland
is 5.7. The recent Health and Demographic Survey reports
that only 13 percent of children aged 12-23 months were
completely vaccinated, which includes BCG (tuberculosis),
polio (3x), pentavalent (3x), and measles.
Malnutrition
Malnutrition (Global Acute Malnutrition and Severe Acute
Malnutrition) poses a serious public health problem
throughout the country and is further aggravated by recurrent
droughts. The following statistics collected during the
recent nationwide demographic health survey clearly show
the current situation:
• As a measure of chronic malnutrition, 21 percent of
children under the age of five are stunted or are a
lower-than-average height for their age, which is below
the Africa region average of 30.7 percent (Global
Nutrition Report 2021).
• As a measure of acute malnutrition, 13 percent of children
under-five have a lower-than-average weight
for their height, which is above the Africa region
average of 6 percent (Global Nutrition Report 2021).
• 69 percent of newborns are breastfed in the first
hour of their life, whereas 30 percent of Somaliland
children aged 0-5 months are exclusively breastfed.
Major Communicable Diseases
• Tuberculosis (TB): TB remains as one of the major
public health problems in Somaliland, though the
disease incidence has been dropping progressively.
According to MoHD data, TB infections have fallen
from 285 per 100,000 people in 2016 to 200 per
100,000 people in 2020.
• HIV/AIDs: Data collected at sentinel sites for pregnant
women indicates that the mean HIV prevalence
has been dropping since 2004, when it was at 1.4
percent, reaching 1.01 percent in 2010 and 0.67 percent
in 2014. The decline, which is statistically significant,
continues through the most recent sentinel
survey of 2018, when it was 0.15 percent.
• Malaria: The seven districts of Baki, Borama, Lughaya,
Zeila, Gabiley, Hargeisa (rural), and Berbera
account for over 90 percent of all malaria cases in
the country. Human activity in urban areas has led to
an increase in favourable mosquito breeding spots in
typically small, shallow, open, and sunlit water pools.
Nonetheless, the country has had nearly zero deaths
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 87
from malaria for the last five-to-ten years.
• Hepatitis B: Hepatitis is a major public health challenge
in terms of morbidity and mortality. To combat
the disease, hepatitis B vaccination has been introduced
in routine immunization programmes. There
has been additional focus on hepatitis B vaccination
for high-risk populations, including health workers,
and screening for both hepatitis B and C among
clinical at-risk groups and vulnerable populations.
As a result, the infection rate has dropped from 150
per 100,000 people to 51 per 100,000 people, which
is well under the NDP II target of 130 per 100,000
people.
• Other major communicable diseases: These include
diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory infections, and
a few neglected tropical diseases (leprosy, schistosomiasis,
and leishmaniasis). Access to sanitation
facilities continues to be a major challenge, with
only 38 percent of households having access to
an improved sanitation facility and only 41 percent
of households using improved sources of drinking
water. Water, health, and sanitation (WASH) programmes
should be strengthened to include the
provision of safe water, the expansion of adequate
water treatment and storage in the home, improved
handwashing facilities and practices, and the use of
adequate sanitation facilities.
Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs)
Cardiovascular issues, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory
problems are continuing to rise and put a heavy
burden on the health system, as well as on individuals and
households. Lifestyles are critical in the prevention of the
majority of NCDs. Tobacco use and smoking in all its forms,
khat consumption, low physical exercise levels, especially
in schools and for women, a high intake of salt and sugar,
and a poor diet in general are the common risk factors for
most of NCDs.
Mental health disorders are widespread, namely schizophrenia,
depression, and psychosis, due to substance
abuse, such as khat, and other socioeconomic factors. As
part of a new initiative, community-based programmes in
strong partnership with civil society organisations have
been launched and a national strategy has been developed
to tackle these issues.
12.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
• Strengthening the participation and inclusion of all
stakeholders in the design and formulation of policy
instruments for different themes. Public health laws
and regulations need to be aligned with the most updated
policies of the sector. This will require a major
review of most existing legal frameworks.
• Addressing the weak coordination structures (or lack
thereof) to improve health service delivery. Functional
national, regional, and district level coordination
forums need to be established.
• Addressing human capacity constraints, both in
terms of the number of healthcare workers and the
types of specialists needed in the sector. These
include anaesthesia, physiotherapy, pharmacy, and
biomedical engineers. This is exacerbated by the
limited opportunities for professional capacity development
and compensation.
• Developing a realistic financing strategy for the
health sector, aimed at mobilising funds from different
sources. The sector is underfunded due to
limited budget allocation.
• Improving the quality of healthcare in most settings,
as well as expanding the provision of essential
services, particularly to the nomadic population and
remote rural communities.
• Strengthening the Health Information Management
Systems, with emphasis on data collection and analysis
at all levels to support evidence-based decision
making, policy development, and health research.
• Combatting the widespread use of sub-standard
drugs, irrational medicine use, and the misuse of
health technologies.
12.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: To increase access to acceptable
quality healthcare services.
Outcome 1: By 2027, improve coverage of the
Essential Package of Health Services (EPHS).
The Ministry of Health Development, with support from its
partners, will achieve this outcome through the following
priority interventions:
1. Strengthening services for Reproductive, Maternal,
Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health (RMNCAH).
Reproductive and maternal services constitute the
provision of services and interventions involving
women before and during pregnancy. Newborn care
consists of the first 28 days of life. Children are considered
years 0-5 and adolescents between ages 10
to 19 (WHO).
• Improving information management for evidence-
based decision making to improve
performance at all levels.
• Supporting and expanding integrated maternal,
neonatal, and childcare services. This includes
antenatal care, Basic Emergency Obstetric
Care (BemOC), postnatal care, immunizations,
nutrition, and all related support services. This
also means increased coverage of Comprehensive
Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care
services (CEmONC).
• Promoting community involvement in all interventions.
• Tackling major adolescent health issues including
STIs, road injuries, mental health, and
substance abuse.
2. Strengthening nutritional services.
• Supporting preventive services against malnutrition
in children under-five, with an emphasis
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 88
on the first 1,000 days of life and provide care
and appropriate treatment for acute/chronic
malnutrition.
3. Preventing and controlling communicable diseases.
• In principle, the strategy regarding communicable
diseases is to increase awareness on
prevention and early detection of infections to
reduce the risk of transmissions. The following
interventions are based on this principle.
HIV/AIDS
4. Ensuring people know their status by encouraging
universal HIV counselling and testing.
5. People living with HIV (PLWHIV) will be provided with
life-long treatment through a range of interventions
as well as enhanced HIV/TB collaborative services.
6. Reducing the number of HIV infections by targeting
Behaviour Change Communication (BCC), enhancing
the provision of post-exposure prophylaxis for target
populations, eliminating vertical transmissions, and
improving testing and treatment.
Tuberculosis
7. Increasing TB treatment coverage through:
• Improving access to TB diagnosis and care,
including for children
• Increasing the utilisation of community health
workers for TB screening
• Establishing a cross-border TB patient monitoring
system
• Expanding and strengthening on-going in-service
training for all health workers on TB control
8. Ensuring the uninterrupted supply of quality-controlled
drugs at all facilities, taking a community-
based approach to Directly Observed Treatment
(DOT) of resistant TB cases.
9. Increasing annual case detection of MDR-TB and
improving the management MDR-TB through the
supply of the quality assured detection equipment in
all National TB Programme (NTP) facilities as well as
increased training and expanded treatment capacity.
Malaria
10. Ensuring universal access to appropriate malaria
prevention and improving case management interventions.
This will help reach the target of the
country-wide malaria elimination drive of at least 10
malaria-free districts.
Hepatitis
11. Raising awareness of viral hepatitis through campaigns
from both public and private healthcare
providers.
12. Monitoring health sector responses to viral hepatitis
by monitoring trends of transmission, stopping mother-
to-child transmission of hepatitis B, and preventing
healthcare related transmission of hepatitis B and C.
13. Reducing the burden of non-communicable diseases,
including mental health:
• Developing the NCD Policy and Strategy, with
attention to multisectoral aspects, and reviewing
the overall regulatory frameworks in the
sector.
• Establishing a National Cancer registry and
National Oncology Centre.
• Capacity building for healthcare workers across
all NCDs, with an emphasis on mental healthcare
providers.
• Enhancing the health referral system and improving
collaboration with the private sector.
This will further boost emergency response
capabilities.
14. Strengthening the health referral system and health
service quality.
• Enhancing the referral system to ensure better
access to quality secondary health services in
cooperation with private sector health facilities.
Outcome 2: By 2027, a more resilient health system
has been built guided by the sector’s Health System
Conceptual Framework
A resilient health system is one where the health actors,
institutions, and population can adequately respond to a
crisis while maintaining core services. It requires an integrated
approach ranging from policy and coordination to
collaboration between actors.
Building the health system includes the following building
blocks:
• Leadership and governance
• Health information system
• Health workforce
• Medicine and technology
• Infrastructure
• Health financing
The Ministry of Health Development, with support from its
partners, will achieve this outcome through the following
priority interventions:
Leadership and Governance
1. Developing sound policies, strategies, and plans for
the health sector.
• Strengthening the existing policies, strategies,
and plans for the sector, ensuring they are
anchored in the overall National Health Policy.
• The policy development will be inclusive and
encompassing, involving the private sector and
partners in the health sector.
2. Strengthening the health legislative and regulatory
framework.
• This must be done in line with the new policies
and will require amendments to existing public
health laws.
• The laws must also systematically address
oversight by accrediting and licensing healthcare
professionals and health service delivery
institutions.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 89
3. Improving coordination and partnership and fostering
effective decentralisation.

by speeding up the accreditation of healthcare
professionals and the licensing of health service
delivery and training institutions.
Health Information System
5. Improving and innovating the health information
system.
• The current District Health Information System
(DHIS2) will be improved by fully or partially
integrating all vertical health programmes into
the platform. Also, digitized data entry will be
made possible at the health facility level and
in some of the districts. This will improve data
quality, management, analysis, interpretation,
and dissemination mechanisms at all levels.
6. Conducting critical health research activities.
• With sufficient data, through the Health Information
system, critical health research activities
will be undertaken at the national level to
inform policy and preventive and curative interventions.
7. Strengthening and improving the sector’s monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) system.
• A results-based monitoring framework will be
established that allows for annual reviews of
operational benchmarks and mid- and end of
term evaluation activities. This will feed into the
overall NDP III evaluations.
Health Workforce
8. Sustaining the production of adequate health workers.
• Regular and coordinated health workforce
planning, involving regional and/or national
Ministries of Health, Education, and Finance.
• Developing realistic and needs-based plans for
health workforce development.

Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 93
Observations
The government is committed to improving health outcomes
with support from its partner organisations, based
on internationally accepted guidelines and standards. Providing
basic health services and building a strong and resilient
health system constitute the bulk of the expenditure
in this sector. The “Cost estimates per outcome and MDA”
table shows that the total cost to provide the Essential
Package of Health Services, under Outcome 1, is estimated
at US$157.1 million, while building resilience in the sector,
under Outcome 2, will cost US$180.8 million over the five
year period. Together, they account for 90 percent of the
total estimated budget.
Health promotion and education is key to preventative
healthcare. An estimated US$16.1 million under Outcome 3
is expected to be spent over the plan period.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the importance of
disaster response and preparedness for public health. For
this reason, an estimated US$29.1 million, under Outcome
4, will be needed to build this structure for continued response
to the pandemic and any future health disasters.
Regarding the outcome targets, the positive results
obtained during the NDP II period, because of providing
the EPHS, are expected to improve at approximately the
same steady pace. However, efforts will be considerably increased
to improve the number of fully immunized children
between 12 and 23 months according to WHO standards.
WATER, SANITATION, AND HYGIENE
Chapter 13
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 95
13.1 Introduction
Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) are essential for
human health. In recognition of this, as well as the adverse
water situation in the country, the Somaliland Vision 2030
prioritises waterworks and distribution systems, as well as
solid and liquid waste disposal systems for households and
all establishments. The National Water Policy and National
Water Act guide the government and partners in addressing
the acute water situation in the country, especially in
the eastern regions where communities are more affected
by droughts. Sanitary facilities remain a challenge in rural
areas, as well as in expanding urban areas. Urbanization
has also exerted more pressure on existing infrastructure.
The government and its partners continue to invest in the
WASH sector, guided by the Integrated Water Resources
Management and Investment Plan (IWRMIP) 2020-2050,
which systematically sets out to improve the overall water
supply in the country. As a country in a semi-arid region
with frequent droughts, the importance of the IWRMIP cannot
be overemphasised, as underground water remains the
main source of drinking water in Somaliland.
Livestock rearing is an important source of livelihoods for
most rural communities and the nomadic population, and
a crucial economic activity for the country. It is therefore
imperative to involve rural communities in a sustainable
water management system which integrates the provision
of water for people and livestock.
Despite recent gains, sanitation and hygiene remain a
challenge against a backdrop of scarce water and insufficient
sanitation infrastructure, even for public facilities
like schools and hospitals. This exacerbates the situation
for women and vulnerable communities like Internally Displaced
People (IDPs).
13.2 Situational Analysis
Water: Policy and Legal Reforms
The National Water Act (2011) mandates the Ministry of
Water Resources Development with the overall responsibility
of water resources development and management.
Subsequently, its regulation, complementary policies, and
procedural manuals were developed to support the effective
implementation of water development. Key among
these are:
• The National Water Act (No. 49 of 2011)
• National Water Regulation
• National Water Policy
• Rural Water Management Manual
• Operations and Maintenance Manual
• Urban Water Management Manual
Water Infrastructure Development in
Hargeisa
Water development in Hargeisa showed significant progress,
bringing the proportion of the population with access
to improved water sources to an estimated 35 percent (out
of 1.2 million people). The following developments can be
highlighted:
• In 2018, the Hargeisa Water Agency (HWA) signed
the contract of the Hargeisa City Distribution Network,
budgeted for 23 million euros.
• In 2018, HWA constructed four reservoirs of 900m3
each, plus 62 km of transmission and distribution
pipes.
• In 2018, HWA constructed a new high-capacity
booster station at Geed-Deeble. Between 2019 and
2021, the wellfield collector pipe was completed,
connecting 17 boreholes with the booster station.
Water Infrastructure Development in
Other Areas
The other major towns that had their water supply expanded
in the aforementioned period are Wajale, Erigavo,
Burao, and Las Anod. Total additional water infrastructure
developed in the NDP II period:
• 164 new boreholes drilled
• 155 boreholes rehabilitated
• 176 mini-water systems established or rehabilitated
• 79 shallow wells constructed or rehabilitated
• 65 earth dams constructed or rehabilitated
Sanitation and Hygiene: Policy and Legal
Reforms
To improve sanitation and hygiene, the following policies
and strategies were adopted:
• The National Water Act (2011, amended in 2018)
• Somaliland Waste Management and Sanitation Law
(No. 83 of 2018), as amended
Sanitation and Hygiene Outreach
• The distribution of hygiene kits in conjunction with
hygiene promotion through the mass media has taken
place in all regions, reaching more than 400,000
households while also targeting Internally Displaced
Persons (IDPs).
• Open defecation is still a common practice in the
rural areas, leading to serious public health risks. The
“Community-Led Total Sanitation” approach, through
awareness campaigns and technical assistance in
the construction of pit-latrines, has been an important
instrument during the NDP II period in helping entire
villages become free of open defecation. Villagers
use their own resources in building the latrines.
13.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
Water
• Rehabilitation and expansion of water source infrastructure
in strategic areas.
• Coordination of interventions between the government
and WASH partners to optimise scope and
impact by reducing duplication and improving economies
of scale.
• Effective policy coordination with stakeholders on
drought mitigation measures.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 96
Sanitation and Hygiene
• Eliminate infrastructure deficiencies in public institutions,
such as education and health facilities, and
ensure that all have gender-segregated facilities.
• Community-led initiatives to increase ownership and
awareness and promote the construction of latrines.
• Policy and legal reforms to strengthen synergies
between government institutions.
13.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
During the plan period, the government and stakeholders
will strive to build on the successes of past years and tackle
the constraints and lingering issues in the sector. Broadly,
these are the strategic objectives of the sector.
Strategic Objective 1: Provide adequate, safe, and affordable
water to the population of Somaliland
Outcome 1: By 2027, there will be strengthened
institutional capacity and adequate regulation
enforcement capacity in line with the amended
National Water Act.
The Ministry of Water Resource Development will achieve
this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Approving and implementing the National Water
Strategy.
2. Addressing regulatory gaps in line with the amended
Water Act.
3. Raising knowledge and awareness of key decision
makers concerning required policies and regulatory

supporting systems for Hargeisa based on the Water
Master Plan.
Outcome 3: By 2027, there will be increased access
for the rural population to adequate, safe, and
affordable drinking water for domestic use and
livestock.
The Ministry of Water Resource Development will achieve
this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Developing mini water systems, construction of
shallow wells, drilling of boreholes, construction of
more earth dams and Hafir dams, and development
of springs by using renewable energy.
2. Implementing water desalination plants in rural areas
with brackish water sources due to geological and
hydro-ecological rock formations.
3. Constructing new water harvesting schemes for
agro-pastoralist communities to increase resilience
to drought/climate change.
4. Installing solar power systems in 300 rural water

with other MDAs, will achieve this outcome through the
following priority interventions:
1. Finalizing the National Sanitation Policy in collaboration
with the MoECC, and subsequently develop a
National Advocacy Strategy in line with this policy.
2. Constructing hygiene and sanitation facilities in public
institutions.
3. Upscaling existing community-led total sanitation
initiatives.
4. Coordinating amongst stakeholders in sanitation
such as government agencies and the wider stakeholders.
The Ministry of Health Development, in collaboration with
other MDAs, will achieve this outcome through the following
priority interventions:
5. Establishing community health promotion programmes
regarding good hygiene and sanitation
practices (developed by all relevant MDAs under
leadership of MoHD).
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 97
Observations
The WASH sector will continue to pursue the following
objectives:
• Capacity building within the sector, partly through
strengthened and enforced regulations for public
and private service providers.
• Improved water access both in urban and rural areas,
as well as improving sanitation in the country.
Outcome 2 concerns urban water supplies, and the Hargeisa
Water Agency interventions towards this outcome
account for 23.9 percent of the total estimated resources of
US$53.7m, with the rest for the Ministry of Water Resource
Development in the remaining six urban centres. Lack of
access to drinking water is also severe in rural communities,
both for people and livestock. In a bid to improve this,
a total of US$105.9 million is needed from the government
and its partners under Outcome 3.
The following outcome targets merit highlighting:
• After addressing the regulatory gaps of the National
Water Act and allowing for a reasonable period for
service providers to modify their operations to ensure
compliance, the MoWRD will capacitate staff
and initiate inspection visits to enforce the amended
regulations. It is expected that by 2026 a total of 80
percent of service providers will be showing a “satisfactory”
performance based on the inspection visit
reports, both for public and private operators.
• In both urban and rural water supplies, it is expected
that an additional ten percent of the population will
have access to clean drinking water sources, bringing
access to urban water supplies to just over 60
percent and access to rural water supplies to just
under half of the population at the end of the NDP
III period.

SOCIAL PROTECTION
Chapter 14
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 99
14.1 Introduction
Article 19 of the Somaliland Constitution articulates that
“the state shall be responsible for the health, care, development,
and education of the mother, the child and the disabled
who have no one to care for them, and the mentally
handicapped persons who are not able and have no one
to care for them.” Recognising this, the Somaliland Vision
2030 aspires to build a nation with an effective social protection
system that cares for the poor, vulnerable, and at
risk. In line with the constitution and the National Vision, the
social protection sector envisions achieving a resilient and
socially cohesive society in which all members can access
the minimum protection that enables them to maintain and
improve their living standards throughout their life.
Most families in Somaliland live on very low incomes and
are vulnerable to a range of shocks throughout their lives,
which impact their living standards at any given point in
time. Entire communities in Somaliland are frequently
affected by natural disasters such as recurrent droughts
or epidemics. The frequency and severity of these are
increasing due to climate change. These circumstances
were worsened by the COVID-19 crisis, causing a severe
setback to Somaliland’s economy and negatively impacting
livelihoods.
Individuals and families are continuously vulnerable to common
risks faced throughout their lifetimes, which frequently
cause insecurities in household income, consumption, and
accumulation of productive assets. These challenges underline
the importance of establishing a sustainable social
protection system that protects citizens throughout their
lifetimes and enables them to maintain a dignified life.
Social protection models recognize that social transfers
serve three important functions: to provide for those unable
to provide for themselves, to prevent vulnerable households
from shocks, and to help families lift themselves out
of poverty.
14.2 Situational Analysis
Policy and Legal Framework
The overarching social protection legal and policy framework
aims to protect the rights of citizens throughout their
lifetimes. The government recognises that all members of
society are vulnerable to poverty, but certain demographic
groups are at greater risk, such as women, children, older
people, and persons with disabilities.
Table 12 summarizes the national legislative and policy
instruments setting out the relevant rights of citizens for
social protection.

In addition, the Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs,
and Family (MESAF) has established internal regulations
that guide the delivery of cash transfer programmes with
development partners in Somaliland. These are not legally
binding regulations, but guidelines endorsed by parties to
increase local ownership and accountability and maximize
the impact of the cash transfer programmes.
Social Protection Schemes in Somaliland
There is a longstanding religious and cultural heritage that
promotes social solidarity among citizens. Traditional and
informal institutions strongly promote charitable giving
and have provided mechanisms for redistribution across
society. Somaliland’s social protection systems are broadly
categorized into four major components.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 100
Traditional and Informal Support
Mechanisms
The Islamic value of almsgiving is embedded in Somaliland’s
society. This is an integral part of the national social
contract, which promotes social solidarity and voluntary
giving, even before formal public administration started in
the country. The main existing instruments are zakat and
sadaqah, alongside instruments such as Qaandhaan and
others, which are administered as voluntary giving.
Due to their voluntary nature, no reliable data is available
on their coverage, but these instruments are a mainstay
in society and are mostly community-led. For example, in
Awdal, zakat funds mobilise voluntary contributions from
citizens and private companies (as well as international
remittances) to finance education and infrastructure in addition
to the usual income support. A demonstrative case
is in Borama, where zakat also financed both education
and infrastructure projects. The peak periods of giving are
during Ramadan and Eids.
Moreover, the Department of Zakat Registration in the
Ministry of Endowment and Religious Affairs sometimes receives
zakat voluntarily from public and private institutions
and redistributes the funds to vulnerable communities.
Social Transfer Pilot Schemes and
Project-based Interventions
Through the support of Somaliland’s international partners,
several social protection schemes provide long-term and
predictable support to certain communities across the
country. Development partners coordinate funds with
the Government of Somaliland to provide direct transfer
payments to the most vulnerable people in communities
affected by crisis, including droughts, where incomes,
livelihoods, employment opportunities, or economic productions
are minimal or have ceased to exist.
Development partners such as the World Bank, WFP,
UNICEF, Save the Children, World Vision, Concern Worldwide,
and Care International have partnered with government
agencies such as the MESAF, the National Disaster
Preparedness and Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR), the
National Displacement and Refugee Agency (NDRA), and
local partners to transfer much-needed cash to crisis-affected
communities. The ongoing social transfer project includes
a World Bank-funded safety net for a human capital
project. The Government of Finland funded the child-sensitive
social protection project and shock-responsive social
protection project, and the EU-funded ILED project has a
social safety net component.
Social Insurance
The Public Pension Scheme was launched during the NDP
II period, which established a contributory system for the
armed forces and civil servants that includes pensions and
benefits provided in the event of sickness, injury, or disability.
The pension scheme for the armed forces is already
in existence and is governed by the Somaliland Armed
Forces Pensions and Gratuities Law (No. 88/2019), while
the pension scheme bill for civil servants is going through
the process of becoming a law. The civil servants’ pension
scheme bill includes the establishment of the National
Pension Authority, which will manage public pension funds.
Even though the Public Pension Scheme’s legal frameworks
are currently being drafted, public service members
are already enrolled in the scheme and make monthly contributions.
The scheme is co-financed by contributions from
public servants and from the Government of Somaliland.
The contribution rate for public servants is five percent of
their monthly salary, while the Government of Somaliland
contributes seven percent of their respective salary. Upon
reaching the retirement age of 65 years, all eligible public
servants will be entitled to a monthly retirement benefit,
with the amount received calculated based on the number
of years of service and the salary earned during the last
month of employment (up to a maximum of 50 percent of
salary). If public servants retire early due to a disability or
illness, they can access a gratuity payment as a lump sum.
In the event of the death of the entitled recipient, benefits
will be transferred to the surviving spouse, child, or parent
for the remainder of their lifetime or a fixed period.
Social Care Services
Due to limited human resources and financial capacity,
social care service provision is limited in Somaliland and
relies strongly on the support of local and international
NGOs. The MESAF partners with SOS Children’s Village
Somaliland for the Family Strengthening Programme, which
aims to prevent family separation and provide support to
children at risk of losing parental care through case management
support. The programme is active in three regions
of Somaliland, assisting 912 families and 6,011 children.
WAAPO Safe House provides care services for gender-
based violence (GBV) survivors and other vulnerable
groups with funding from UNICEF, UNHCR, and UNFPA.
There are 48 childcare centres across the country providing
shelter, education, food, and other services for children
without parents or at risk of losing parental care who are
living in vulnerable circumstances. The MESAF fully funds
three of these centres from the national budget, while
Islamic organisations primarily sponsor the others. MESAF
also supports two special needs schools in Hargeisa and
Borama, and two rehabilitation centres for people with
disabilities (PWDs) that provide physiotherapy, mobility devices,
and counselling services. The MESAF is also running
a mental health centre with national budget funding while
providing guidance and supervision for the Somaliland
HIV/AIDS Network’s (SAHAN) mental health services, with
funding from the Red Crescent.
The MESAF runs a 24/7 hotline service providing free information
and support for people facing difficulties or who
are at risk. The MESAF has set up child protection desks at
the Wajaale and Lawyo-Ado migration corridors, providing
case management services such as family identification,
public health and safety, and transport services for migrant
children. The MESAF’s counselling service centre deals
with family issues, providing spousal dispute resolution services
including a grant of US$500-1,000 to start businesses
if the dispute is related to household family difficulties. This
is part of the MESAF’s income generation grants for about
100 women each year with funding from the national budget.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 101
14.3 Challenges and Key Issues
• Developing a functional Social Protection Policy that
sets the strategic direction of the sector, provides
leadership, and improves coordination to ensure coherence
and avoid duplication to efficiently manage
limited resources.
• Expanding the currently limited legal and regulatory
frameworks to facilitate the delivery of social protection
interventions.
• Resolving the conflict of mandates among government
institutions. These can lead to a duplication
of efforts and impede the efficient delivery of social
protection services.
• Mobilising additional resources to deliver needed
social protection services for vulnerable groups
in the community. The sector still relies heavily on
humanitarian and development actors to provide
protection, which are usually short term in nature and
therefore unsustainable.
• The absence of labour unions to advocate for and
protect labour rights increases vulnerability and the
need for social protection schemes for those who
become unemployed or receive less income to sustain
decent living conditions.
14.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Strategic Objective 1: To build a resilient and cohesive
society in which all members can access minimum
protections that enable them to maintain and improve their
living standards.
Outcome 1: By 2027, robust, well-functioning social
protection systems are in place at national and
sub-national levels.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Finalizing and enforcing the Social Protection Policy.
The MESAF will submit the draft policy to the cabinet
for approval. This policy is the sectoral guiding document,
and therefore, the finalization and meaningful
implementation of this policy is vital for building a
robust social protection system in Somaliland.
2. Developing technical guidelines for the Social Protection
Policy and Strategy. The MESAF will effectively
operationalise the National Social Protection Policy
by translating the policy objectives into concrete
actions, a comprehensive implementation strategy,
and relevant technical guiding documents.
3. Developing a single registry for social protection
schemes. This single registry system will facilitate
the cross-coordination of social protection schemes
in the country. The registry will be consolidated into a
single common database, structuring and organising
socio-economic and demographic data on households.
This will create a single entry point for all
programmes and improve evidence-based decision
making regarding vulnerable people in the country.
4. Strengthening the existing social protection coordination
mechanisms. The MESAF will strengthen and
unify the social protection coordination mechanism
for all sector stakeholders and expand operations to
the sub-national level.
5. Strengthening social protection institutions’ capacities
both at national and sub-national levels. The
MESAF will strengthen the capacity of government
institutions on social protection both at the national
and sub-national levels, ensuring mandated agencies
will have the capacity to deliver social protection
schemes for poor and marginalized communities.
Outcome 2: By 2027, vulnerable households can
access social transfers to address socioeconomic
risks.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Providing benefits to children under-five in the four
regions in Somaliland that have the highest prevalence
of stunting among children under five years
of age. The MESAF will gradually expand this Child
Benefit Scheme to these four regions, reaching all
children aged zero to four years by 2028. This will
be achieved through the registration of children at
birth in the targeted regions, without removing any
children who have been benefiting from the scheme
since its first year of implementation. At this point,
the capacity of government agencies will have been
strengthened to deliver the Child Benefit Scheme.
2. Designing and implementing a universal child
disability benefit for the most vulnerable children
in Somaliland. The government will prioritise the
implementation of a child disability benefit scheme,
including transportation, medical treatment, therapy,
and specialised schooling, for some of the most
vulnerable children at risk of social and economic
exclusion. The Child Disability Benefit also intends
to compensate families who experience a loss in
income due to having to give up work to care for
their children with higher needs. The Child Disability
Benefit will initially cover all children with disabilities
aged zero to 15 years.
3. Providing humanitarian cash transfers for those families
affected by shocks and climate emergencies. In
collaboration with other mandated public institutions,
the MESAF will create a shock-responsive social protection
mechanism for responding to emergencies
such as droughts, floods, and other climate shocks.
4. Strengthening and expanding social care service
delivery at the national and sub-national levels, including
the expansion of childcare services to all six
regions of Somaliland, as well as social care services
for the elderly and people with a disability, providing
specialised care when needed.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 102
Outcome 3: By 2027, effective social insurance
mechanisms for the working-age population have
been established.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Conducting a scoping study to identify frameworks
to build a multi-tiered social insurance system. This
will identify opportunities to build a package of social
insurance benefits. The government will explore the
feasibility of implementing unemployment, maternity,
survivors, sickness, and potentially other social
insurance mechanisms that allow the working-age
population to draw benefits when they experience
certain contingencies.
2. Assessing the feasibility of implementing short-term
complementary interventions for rural communities,
such as weather-based and livestock insurance
products that enhance income protection for those
relying on livestock and agricultural livelihoods. This
is important as it will take time for rural communities
to benefit from social insurance.
3. Establishing robust social insurance systems. Based
on the outcomes of the scoping study on the social
insurance sector, the Somaliland government will
start incrementally building a social insurance system
for vulnerable populations. This will also require
strengthening operational systems and administrative
processes for delivering social protection
services across the country.
4. Implementing a universal pension scheme for civil
servants. The government will prioritise the implementation
of a basic universal social pension by
2025. This will be a contributory pension scheme
co-financed by public servants and contributions
from the Somaliland government. Public servants will
receive benefits when they retire, as well as in cases
of disability or long-term illness. In the case of death,
the next of kin will receive those benefits.

natural conservation. Subsidiary legislation such as the
Forest and Wildlife Act (2015) and the National Environment
Protection Act (2018) reinforce proper management of flora
and fauna to support sustainable livelihoods.
As populations grow, economic activities to support livelihoods
often exert pressure on the environment. For instance,
livestock rearing is a mainstay in the economy, as it
is one of the main foreign exchange earners for the country
and a major source of income and employment, especially
for the rural population. Livestock rearing depends largely
on forest cover for grazing and sustainable management of
water. The sustainable management of grazing land is thus
needed for continuous support to the sub-sector.
Due to its geographic location, persistent drought in the
region affects Somaliland’s socio-economic development,
hence the prioritisation of the sector both as a pillar in the
Vision 2030 and a sector in the National Development
Plans. Overall, Somaliland intends to be a state with a
healthy and well-managed environment that is productive
and sustainable.
15.2 Situational Analysis
Environmental Protection and Climate
Change: Policy and Legal Reform
Building on the National Environment Policy that was approved
in 2015, several policies and laws were approved
and enacted to mainstream environmental management
issues, strengthen resilience, and promote measures to
improve adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and
natural disasters. Key among these are:
• The National Environmental Management Act
(79/2018)
• The Waste Management Act (83/2018)
• Formulation of the Climate Change Policy
• The Land Policy (2022)
• Ongoing capacity development for the domestication
of international conventions
Fiscal Incentives
The government aligned its economic policies towards
supporting its commitment to sustainable management of
the environment by adopting tax policies to incentivise behavioural
change on consumption and production patterns.
These include a tax exemption for the use of liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG), targeted to reduce the use of charcoal; a
tax reduction for equipment needed to produce renewable
energy; tax relief for small-scale factories that produce
alternatives to plastic bags; waste recycling schemes (e.g.,
plastic bags to tiles); and subsidies for private investors
who produce briquettes from mesquite trees — an invasive
species which affects productive land.
Grazing Reserves
Grazing lands are the most degraded land type in the
world, particularly in arid and semiarid areas, as a result
of improper human activities such as overgrazing coupled
with drought.
In situations where the degraded grazing land has not
been irreversibly damaged, application of appropriate
grazing management is an ecologically viable solution for
their restoration. This is particularly necessary for grazed
lands with a long history of grazing by large herbivores,
including livestock. Excluding domestic animals from such
ecosystems may lead to several ecological problems, such
as a loss of biodiversity and devastating wildfires.
To support livestock rearing as a crucial sector of the economy,
20 grazing reserves were successfully assessed and
four were restored. In addition, five additional communal
grazing sites were established and brought under community
management in the Toghdeer and Sool regions,
an increase in the surface area of grazing reserves from
20,000 to 116,700 hectares during the NDP II period. A
demonstration rangeland site was established at Illinta Bari.
Illegal enclosures, which limit access to communal grazing
lands, were removed, primarily in the Maroodi Jeex and
Togdheer regions.
Marine Reserves
Through collaboration with stakeholders and development
partners, work to protect biodiversity hotspots has started
in Zeylac. It was inaugurated as the first marine protected
area in the country in early 2020. It will provide protection
for coral reef and mangrove ecosystems while conserving
valuable fish stocks for local fishermen.
Wildlife Protection
With the collaboration of stakeholders, wildlife protection
initiatives were embarked on to protect certain species
and reign in illegal trafficking in the region. In the past few
years, 90 cheetahs, 40 antelopes, birds of prey, wild cats,
caracals, and over 400 lizards and tortoises were rescued
from being illegally trafficked out of Somaliland. With the
support of specialist wildlife conservationists, three wildlife
orphanage centres (Dabis, Masalaaha, and Geedeeble)
have been established.
Deforestation and Soil Erosion
Deforestation and soil erosion continue to threaten the
livelihoods of communities throughout the country, varying
by location. To address this, seven nurseries (in Debis,
Geedeeble, El Afweyn, Las Anod, Owdweyne, Ainaba,
and Shurko) were established. Similarly, five nurseries in
Borama, Berbera, Erigavo, Burao, and Hargeisa have been
rehabilitated. A total of 1,200,000 multi-purpose seedlings
were produced in these nurseries and distributed widely to
major urban centres and rural settlements, with 70 percent
of trees successfully planted.
Community Awareness Campaigns
Comprehensive awareness programmes were conducted
using various communication methods (Radio Hargeisa,
social media, trainings, workshops, and field trips). There
are plans to integrate these programmes into the school
curricula. The initial discussions with the Ministry of Education
have already started.
Drought Resilience
The National Disaster Preparedness Strategy (2019) includes
mechanisms to improve drought resilience. In line
with this strategy, various soil and water conservation programmes
were embarked on, including the rehabilitation
of 30 berkhads in Togdheer and 11 berkhads in Sanaag, as
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 106
well as the establishment of four sand dams in the Maroodi
Jeex region and two earth dams in Ceel-Afwayn and Balli-
Gubadle districts.
Reduction of Charcoal Consumption
As part of measures to reduce the dependency on charcoal
for cooking, 20,000 fuel-efficient stoves were distributed to
households, and the government subsidized and distributed
7,000 LPG cylinders to poor households in major towns
throughout the country.
Frankincense
Frankincense trees produce an aromatic resin, called frankincense
or olibanum, which is used in incense and perfumes.
It is obtained from trees of the genus Boswellia by
“tapping”, a process of making incisions on the bark for
exudates. The trees grow wildly in vast regions and are
owned by clans who have control over production and
marketing.
Frankincense trees are important to Somaliland’s economy,
producing gums and resins that support over 70 percent of
households’ incomes in producing areas. The annual export
value in 2021 was US$18.2 million. However, over-exploitation
from unsustainable tapping greatly affects existing
frankincense trees in Somaliland. High demand and poverty
have increased tapping rates, reducing the regeneration
of trees and increasing rates of tree mortality.
Disaster Preparedness and Response:
Policy and Legal Reform
To improve disaster preparedness and response capacity,
the following policies and strategies were adopted or drafted:
• The Draft National Disaster Risk Management Policy
(2019)
• National Disaster Preparedness Strategy (2019)
• National Disaster Contingency Plan (2019)
• National Food Reserves Policy (2021)
• Multi-Hazard Early Warning Framework (2021)
Food Reserves
The government constructed seven food reserve warehouses
across the country, in Burao, Berbera (two), Hargeisa,
Abaarso, and Gabiley (two). To complement the efficient
use of these facilities, relevant personnel were trained on
quality control and food reserve management, disaster risk
reduction, early warning systems, and geographical information
systems. Furthermore, more response offices were
constructed in Gabiley, Berbera, Borama and Abaarso.
Community Engagement
Community engagement on community-based disaster
risk management was conducted, covering 150 villages
across the country. Early warning committees were established
in Sanaag and Togdheer. Following Cyclone Sagar,
NADFOR was involved in the restocking of 9,000 heads of
livestock in Awdal and Maroodi Jeex. Water tankers have
been provided by the National Disaster Preparedness and
Food Reserve Authority (NADFOR) during times of drought,
and flood protection measures were introduced in Awdal,
Gabiley, and Maroodi Jeex.
15.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The major challenges identified for the NDP III period are
the following:
Environmental Protection and Climate
Change
• Accelerating the protection of natural resources by
establishing gazetted protected areas for biodiversity
hotspots with endangered flora and fauna, marine
life, and grazing reserves, while regulating the sustainable
exploitation of natural resources whenever
possible.
• Under leadership of the MoECC, improving the
coordination of multi-sector stakeholders that are
engaged in environmental management and building
resilience to climate change through adaptive
measures and mitigation.
• Improving the management of solid waste while
transforming it into renewable resources by promoting
private sector involvement in the recycling
industry.
• Reducing the use of charcoal from indigenous species
by promoting alternatives for the use of energy
in domestic settings, especially in the urban areas.
• Sustainably growing and harvesting frankincense
trees, working with all stakeholders active in the
value chain.
Disaster Preparedness and Response
• Strengthening the country’s disaster preparedness
by investing in technologically advanced early warning
systems and improving international networking.
• Strengthening the emergency relief supply chain
and reducing the country’s disaster response time
by boosting NADFOR’s access to financial resources,
physical infrastructure, and means of transport.

Observations
Overall, the cost of interventions aimed at achieving the
objectives of the sector amounts to an estimated US$24.3
million for the two institutions within the sector, as depicted
in the cost estimates table.
The budget for the Ministry of Environment and Climate
Change is mainly for coordination activities, improving
legislation, and capacity building to be able to perform a
leading role in environmental management issues.
It is noteworthy to mention that approximately US$12 million
is expected to be contributed from development partners
as investments in sustainable charcoal production, as well
as contributions from the private sector in this endeavour.
The government will support these investments by providing
appropriate fiscal incentives, in line with the overall goal
of sustainable environmental management.
The following outcome targets merit highlighting:
• A more than doubling of Somaliland’s nature reserves
and protected areas:
• Gazetted biodiversity conservation areas are
expected to go from 96,770 hectares in 2021
to 216,770 hectares in 2026, an increase of 124
percent.
• Protected community-managed grazing areas
are expected to go from 116,700 hectares in
2021 to 236,700 hectares in 2026, an increase
of 102 percent.
• The first two marine reserves will have been gazetted
with a total surface area of 79 hectares.
• In urban areas, a reduction of 25 percent in the
consumption of charcoal for domestic purposes
is expected by promoting LPG and stimulating the
local production of charcoal made from the invasive
exotic mesquite (Prosopis juliflora) by offering grants
for the private sector. Total production is expected to
go from the 1,380 tonnes per year that are currently
produced by the three existing plants to 14,900
tonnes over the entire NDP III period by doubling the
number of industrial plants, with a projected growth
of charcoal production per plant of 18.5 percent per
year.
• The establishment of a National Disaster Relief Fund
under NADFOR. This is an important mechanism to
channel and pool funds from the national budget
(contingency funds) and emergency relief partners
once a national disaster has been officially declared,
thus improving NADFOR’s response time.
JUDICIARY SECTOR
Chapter 16
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 112
16.1 Introduction
The Somaliland judiciary is established under chapter four
of the constitution (Articles 97-98). The judiciary consists
of the courts and the procuracy. The judges and members
of the procuracy are independent when exercising their
judicial functions and are guided by the law as stipulated
by Articles 97.2 and 99.2 of the constitution. According to
article 97.2, “the judiciary shall be independent of other
branches of the government.”
The constitution provides for the establishment of a
Supreme Court (which also serves as the Constitutional
Court), courts of appeals (regional level), regional courts,
district courts, and the Courts of the Armed Forces (which
are to be governed by a separate act of parliament). This is
in line with the principle of separation of powers stipulated
in Article 37.3 of the constitution. Furthermore, to ensure
the independence of the judiciary, the constitution placed
the judiciary under the administrative authority of the High
Judicial Commission.
There are also several other constitutional provisions of
the judiciary that act as guiding principles. One of those
is Article 10.2 of the constitution in which the Republic of
Somaliland commits itself to respect and abide by international
law, including international conventions on civil
and political rights, the Universal Declaration of Human
rights (Article 10), the United Nations Basic Principles on
the Independence of the Judiciary, and a number of other
international agreements, such as on children’s rights and
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women (CEDAW). Moreover, chapter three
of the constitution enshrines the fundamental rights and
freedoms of citizens, with the courts serving as the custodian
of these rights and freedoms (Article 21.1). Without the
protection of the judiciary, these rights and freedoms could
be infringed upon or eroded, either by acts of parliament or
by actions and policies of the executive branch.
Another constitutional provision which safeguards the
rights and freedoms of citizens and has direct relevance to
the judiciary is in Article 21.2, which stipulates that “the articles
which relate to fundamental rights and freedoms shall
be interpreted in a manner consistent with the international
conventions on human rights and also with the international
laws referred to in this constitution.” This is particularly
important, as legal interpretation is a key role of the judiciary
(Article 98.1.a). Hence, the development of the judiciary
sector remains critical for the protection of human rights
and upholding the rule of law to ensure citizens’ rights.
16.2 Situational Analysis
Legal Frameworks
Reference is made to the following policy and legal frameworks:
• Somaliland Law of The Organization of The Judiciary
24/2003; 8/2008
• The Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)
• Somaliland Judiciary Strategic Plan (2018-2021)
Attorney General’s Office (AGO)
Article 97 of the constitution stipulates that the state shall
have a judicial branch that adjudicates proceedings between
the government and the public, as well as between
members of the public. The main functions of the Attorney
General’s Office (AGO) are pursuing criminal charges on
behalf of the state, directing investigations and criminal
cases, supervising the conditions of prisons and prison
inmates, assisting vulnerable individuals in civil suits, and
participating in civil suits in which the government is a party
or if public interest so requires.
Judicial Commission (JC)
Judges, other than Supreme Court justices, are appointed
by the Judicial Commission (JC), which was established
under Articles 107 and 108 of the Somaliland Constitution.
Judges hold office until their retirement, generally at 65
years of age. The Chairman of the Supreme Court chairs
the JC, which also consists of two other Supreme Court justices,
the attorney general, two high-ranking civil servants
(the minister of justice and the head of the Civil Service
Agency), and four members of the public selected once
every two years by the two houses of parliament. The JC
handles the promotion and, when necessary, disciplining of
judges, the procedures of which are established in Articles
35-43 of the Organization of the Judiciary Law.
Supreme Court of Somaliland (SCS)
The chairman and judges of the Supreme Court of Somaliland
(SCS) are appointed by the president, in consultation
with the JC, under Article 105 of the constitution. The
appointment of the chairman must be confirmed at a joint
session of both houses of parliament. The president may
dismiss the chairman of the SCS, subject to the approval of
both houses.
Somaliland Courts of Law
The Somaliland courts of law are four different but hierarchically
complementary courts: district courts, regional
court, courts of appeal, and the SCS, which also serves as
the constitutional court. With the addition of four members
selected by the two houses of parliament, the SCS also
serves as the High Court of Justice.
• The district courts of Somaliland are responsible for
adjudicating claims based on matters relating to family
law and succession, hearing civil litigation case
suits of up to three million Somaliland shillings, and
hearing criminal cases punishable by imprisonment
of up three years or fines not exceeding three million
Somaliland shillings.
• The regional courts are responsible for adjudicating
all civil litigations and criminal cases beyond the
district courts’ jurisdiction, dealing with all labour
or employment law claims, and hearing any claims
arising out of local council elections.
• The courts of appeal have a territorial jurisdiction,
hearing all appeals from their respective district
and regional courts. The courts of appeal consist
of five appellate sections: general appellate, assize
appellate, family law, juvenile law, and taxation and
finance.
• The Supreme Court of Somaliland is the highest organ
in the judiciary system and has jurisdiction over
all territory of the Somaliland Republic. It currently
consists of eleven members, including the chief justice.
The SCS deals with:
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 113
• All appeals from the appeals courts
• Administrative suits against the decisions of
public bodies
• Declaration of general elections results (both
presidential and parliamentary elections), and
complaints relating to these elections, as well
as hearing appeals from lower courts relating to
local council elections
• Jurisdiction issues between courts of the land
and reviewing its own decisions under the
relevant articles of criminal and civil procedure
codes
The SCS also serves as the Constitutional Court of Somaliland
to:
• Adjudicate suits from interested parties relating to
the constitutionality of acts of decisions of the legislative
and executive branches
• Interpret the constitution and laws when specific
provisions become subject of controversy
• Decide on court decisions which are challenged as
being unconstitutional
The Constitutional Court of Somaliland sits as a full bench.
Furthermore, with an additional four members elected by
the two chambers of the national parliament, the Supreme
Court constitutes the High Court of Justice to hear and
reach decisions on cases against members of parliament
and the Council of Ministers.
Legal Frameworks and Judiciary Reform
The Organization of the Judiciary Law (24/2003) provides
a defined framework for appointing and dismissing judges
and prosecutors, as well as the functions of the AGO and
courts. However, judiciary reform is imperative if the functions
of the judiciary and the AGO are to be well-defined.
Constitutional and legal provisions must be consistent with
the principle of the separation of powers to preserve judicial
independence.
Management and Resources
The administration and management of courts depend
heavily on administrative systems and personnel. These
factors are also related to the physical infrastructure where
personnel work. Without sufficient resources in place to
facilitate smooth administration, the quality and delivery of
justice are compromised.
The Code of Conduct
Somaliland has a code of conduct for judges and prosecutors.
The Department of Inspection and Monitoring at the
JC is responsible for enforcing the code of conduct. The
capacity of the Inspection and Monitoring Scheme (IMS)
under the JC needs to be strengthened to deliver on its
mandate. Furthermore, public awareness and continued
legal education on ethics for judges are required to protect
judicial independence.
Case Management
The current Case Management Information System (CMIS)
focuses only on criminal cases and has limited functionality,
capturing only some cases across the courts and from the
AGO. There is a need to review and upgrade the CMIS to
facilitate caseload allocations, case tracking and mapping,
and electronic case recording. Data protection regulations
need to improve to ensure the confidentiality and privacy
of the clients.
16.3 Challenges and Key Issues
The primary challenges identified for the NDP III period are:
• Revising judicial processes and procedures to meet
relevant demands
• Improving security for judiciary personnel regarding
terrorists and clients with grievances that may threaten
to harm them
• Enhancing infrastructure and other necessary facilities
to improve working conditions and avoid unnecessary
costs put on clients
• Upgrading the CMIS, as it is currently confined to
specific courts and cannot easily be accessed across
the court system
• Facilitating access to judiciary services for people in
remote locations through mobile courts
• Updating laws to meet the requirements of the
criminal justice system. The current legal framework
is a mixture of laws from Somaliland’s British Protectorate,
the Italian colonial era, and the subsequent
period from 1960 to 1990. In particular, the British Colonial
Indian Penal Code is in critical need of revision.
• Appointing female judges, as male judges dominate
the judiciary. No female judges have, so far, been
appointed to the bench due to the Sharia school of
thought. Instead, qualified women are appointed to
other roles, such as court clerks or prosecutors.

CROSS-CUTTING THEMES
Chapter 17
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 117
17.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses the cross-cutting themes of gender,
People with Disabilities (PWDs), Displacement Affected
Communities (DAC), children’s rights, youth, HIV/AIDS, and
rural development. These themes should be an integral
dimension of the NDP III interventions’ design, implementation,
monitoring, and evaluation geared towards achieving
national development priorities. It will involve assessing
the implication for these groups by any planned action,
including legislation, policies, and programmes, in all areas
and levels. This means that all the phases of the NDP III
interventions should consider and respond to the needs
and priorities of these groups to ensure an inclusive development
outcome.
17.2 Gender
Patriarchal social structures relegate women to domestic
activities and often deny them full participation in social,
economic, and political spheres. According to the 2020
Somaliland Health and Demographic Survey, the unemployment
rate for women in Somaliland stands at 30.1
percent compared to 16.4 percent among men. This disparity
is even higher among youth, with 53.8 percent of
women aged 15-24 unemployed or in education, compared
to 24.4 percent of young men in the same age range.
Female-headed households are more likely to be poor
than male-headed households. Although four months of
paid maternity leave followed by a breastfeeding period is
stipulated in Somaliland laws, women in the informal labour
market and self-employed individuals do not enjoy these
rights.
On education, there is a long way to go in achieving universal
educational attainment targets. Only two-fifths of
women (41 percent) aged 15-49 are literate (SLHDS 2020).
Inequitable access prevails in education, especially for rural
communities, the urban poor, and for those with special
needs. Somaliland’s 2020-2021 gross primary enrolment
rate (GER) is 32 percent, of which 36 percent were boys
and 29 percent were girls (Education Statistics Yearbook,
May 2021. This constitutes a gender parity index (GPI) of
0.81. In secondary schools for the same period, the overall
GER was 18 percent, of which 20 precent were boys and 15
percent were girls in, with a GPI of 0.75. In addition, training
modules offered in TVET programmes often discourage
women’s enrolment, affecting their access to employment.
Furthermore, gender inequities extend to the number of female
teachers in the system. The 2021 Education Statistics
Yearbook indicates 19 percent of primary school teachers
and only 4 percent of secondary school teachers are female.
The Somaliland Health and Demographic Survey (SLHDS)
showed that only 40 precent of deliveries were performed
with the help of trained professionals, which means 60 percent
of the births were delivered at homes. Antenatal and
postnatal care is in short supply. Nonetheless, Somaliland’s
maternal mortality rate (MMR) has fallen to 396 deaths
per 100,000 live births, down from 418 in 2014. However,
improvements are needed in nutrition, 6 percent of women
in Somaliland aged 15-49 were moderately to severely
malnourished, with a BMI less than 17 and a height below
145 cm.
The SLHDS underlined that over 70 percent of women
had experienced forms of domestic violence, ranging
from physical assault and the denial of education to forced
marriage, rape, and sexual harassment. Similarly, a 2020
rapid Gender-based Violence/Female Genital Mutilation
(GBV/FGM) assessment by UNFPA shows an increase in
both GBV and FGM incidents since the onset of Covid-19.
In response to these challenges, a sexual offence bill was
drafted and GBV services were expanded at the regional
level during the NDP II period.
Article 8 of the Somaliland Constitution stipulates that “all
Somaliland citizens shall enjoy equal rights and obligations
in the practice of the law and shall not be accorded precedence
on the grounds of clan, birth, language, gender,
property, status, opinion, etc.” In addition, the Somaliland
National Vision 2030 envisages “a caring society meeting
the basic social needs of its members”. Furthermore, the
overall objective of the National Gender Policy is to facilitate
the mainstreaming of the needs and concerns of women
and men, girls, and boys in all areas for sustainable and
equitable development and poverty eradication. The draft
Sexual Offence Bill (SOB), draft Family Law, and National
Employment Policy (2020) are the existing legal frameworks
that advance women’s rights and gender equality.
To increase women’s political representation, the Somaliland
government, civil society organisations, and
international partners have provided financial and logistical
support to female candidates regarding campaign
strategies and election-related undertakings. Twenty-eight
female political aspirants effectively competed in the 2021
parliamentary and local elections. Although they secured
a significant number of votes, only ten have secured seats
in the local councils of small towns. On the other hand, the
number of women in executive leadership positions have
improved, including within cabinet (5.6 percent), and as director
generals (7.7 percent), and department directors (23.1
percent). Furthermore, women’s overall representation in
the civil service has increased from 23.4 percent in 2016 to
26.3 percent in 2020.
In collaboration with humanitarian agencies and CSOs, the
Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family (MESAF)
promotes women’s economic empowerment and control
over resources through self-help groups and access to financial
services, including credit facilities. The ministry lobbies
with other public institutions, private enterprises, and
employers for affirmative action in recruitment processes.
Furthermore, multiple local and international organisations
support the Ministry of Education and Science in promoting
education and TVET programmes. The Somaliland government
pays stipends to public school primary teachers to
encourage the enrolment and retention of children from
poor households.
17.3 Gender: Challenges and Key
Issues
Although there are interventions that are targeted for improving
gender equality, the enormous challenges women
face continues to widen the gender inequality gap.
• Women face complex engendered issues such as
patriarchal structures, violence, lack of control over
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 118
productive resources and limited access to markets.
These issues often reinforce each other and exacerbate
poverty and exclusion while widening gender
inequality.
• Harmful traditional practices, social norms, religious
dogmas, and societal expectations deny women’s
participation in economic, social, and political spheres
in which critical decisions that affect their lives are
reached. Women’s absence in such decision making
creates procedures, policies, and even legal regimes
that increase gender inequality.
• Women and women-owned businesses’ access
to financial services is challenging due to the negative
attitude towards women’s entrepreneurship
entrenched in cultural, religious, and social misconceptions,
which impose unfavourable terms and conditions
on women seeking loans from formal financial
service providers.
• The roles and responsibilities ascribed to women
from childhood hold them back – keeping them in private
spheres and excluding them from participating
in society’s social, political, and economic spheres.
In addition, cultural and social norms limit women’s
mobility to fully participate in the community.
17.4 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Outcome 1: Reduced gender disparities in
social, economic, and political outcomes due to
strengthened gender-responsive services and
systems.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family and
will achieve this outcome through the following priority
interventions:
1. Advocating for meaningful representation and full
participation of women in local and national decision-
making structures. MESAF will work with relevant
stakeholders to achieve fair women’s representation
in elected and appointed leadership positions
in Somaliland public structures.
2. Protecting women and girls from sexual and gender-
based violence through prevention and a GBV
response. MESAF will continue hosting and chairing
the GBV working group and scale it to the regional
and district levels to advance women’s rights and
gender equality.
3. Advancing women’s rights and economic justice, facilitating
increased access of women’s businesses to
the available financial services and entrepreneurship
opportunities.
4. Advocating for gender equality in accessing social
services such as education, healthcare, sanitation,
and water. MESAF will lobby with mandated public
institutions, CSOs and international agencies to provide
gender-responsive social services, particularly
for vulnerable and marginalized groups.
17.5 People With Disabilities
(PWDs)
The 2020 SLHDS indicated that 5 percent of Somaliland’s
population is disabled, equivalent to 210,000 persons. Disability
tends to be framed only within a medical and welfare
framework and misunderstood as an “individual’s problem”.
Therefore, societal responses are often geared to
“help them” or “make them normal” through health-related
interventions. In such approaches, people with disabilities
are identified as ill, different from their non-disabled peers,
and only in need of care. Because the emphasis is on the
medical or “special” needs of people with disabilities, there
is a corresponding neglect of their rights and other needs,
which deepens their exclusion and marginalization.
PWDs are not homogenous; their experience with disability
varies according to personal and socio-economic factors.
Children, women, the elderly, persons with multiple disabilities,
and persons with intellectual and mental impairments
are more vulnerable. Moreover, PWDs who live in rural
settings are more vulnerable than those in urban centres.
PWDs are often reduced to being dependents and not
equally valued members of their community, defined by
an inability to work and being viewed as burden to their
families and the state. PWDs face different environmental,
institutional, attitudinal, and economic barriers that exclude
them from full participation in the social, economic, and
political development spheres. Although a presidential
decree (2013) obliges all service providers to ensure that
buildings are accessible to PWDs, the public and private facilities
that offer services like health, education, or information
are widely inaccessible. Their access to employment
opportunities and participation in the labour market is very
limited. Although MESAF initiated sign language training
and certification, most sources of information for citizens
are largely inaccessible due to limited sign language resources,
audiotapes, braille, or pictorial aids. Therefore, it
is imperative to improve Somaliland’s collective consciousness
and challenge societal barriers so that PWDs can realize
their rights and live prosperous and independent lives.
Article 19 of the Somaliland constitution stipulates “the state
shall be responsible for the welfare of persons with disabilities.”
The Somaliland national vision 2030 elaborates on
the need “to build a nation with an effective social protection
system that cares for the weak and the vulnerable”.
The overall goal of the National Disability Policy (2019) is to
promote an inclusive, barrier-free, and rights-based society
for PWDs. The disability bill is still a draft and should be
enacted and enforced in the NDP III period.
Although PWDs continue to face significant challenges,
various MDAs have made efforts to advance PWDs’ rights.
MESAF, in partnership with development partners, has
conducted awareness-raising and advocacy interventions
that have improved attitudes and behaviours towards
PWDs, but structured and targeted national and community
endeavours are needed for a sustainable solution. The
Ministry of Education and Science increased access to education
of Children with Disabilities (CWD) through schools
that respond to their specific needs and priorities, such as
the Hargeisa School for Deaf and the Somaliland Braille
Centre. However, there still needs to be increased access
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 119
to education and educational attainments for PWDs.
The Somaliland National Disability Federation (SNDF) is
a consortium of disabled people’s organisations in Somaliland
and coordinates efforts to advance their rights.
The SNDF, in partnership with MESAF, SDF member local
NGOs, and development partners, conducted discussions
to address the challenges and barriers facing PWDs and
empower PWDs to claim their rights.
17.6 PWDs: Challenges and Key
Issues
PWDs face a variety of challenges:
• Although a presidential decree (2013) obliges all
service providers to ensure that buildings are accessible
to PWDs, the public and private facilities that
offer services like health, education, or information
are widely inaccessible. For example, most government
institutions are housed in two- or three-story
buildings with no ramps, making it difficult for PWDs
to access them. This excludes PWDs from enjoying
their education, health and information rights and
continues to confine them in private spheres, negatively
impacting their overall well-being.
• Generally, unemployment is a critical issue in Somaliland,
but it is exceptionally high among PWDs.
Although a 2018 presidential decree reserved 5
percent of national employment for PWDs, it is hardly
enforced, and the majority of PWDs remain unemployed.
The National Disability Policy (2014-2018)
was approved in 2014, but an updated version is
expected to guarantee further rights for PWDs. The
policy puts the rights of the PWDs at the centre, such
as through access to mobility devices, health and
information services, and inclusive education.
• The participation of PWDs in politics is very low in
Somaliland. They often are excluded from both appointed
and elected government officials. No PWDs
are ministers, deputy ministers, directors general or
serve in the houses of parliament. These are spaces
where decisions are reached for Somaliland’s communities
but PWDs lack the ability to have a say on
issues that affect their lives.
• Some regulatory frameworks discriminate against
PWDs in holding specific elected roles. For example,
Article 41 of the Somaliland constitution mentions that
an elected official “must be physically and mentally
able to fulfil his duties”. There are also reports that
politically aspirant PWDs were excluded from the
May 2021 parliamentary and local council elections,
as they were deemed to be “physically unfit.” This
is a severe challenge and will exclude PWDs from
decision making, hindering Somaliland’s inclusive
development goals.
• PWDs have limited access to social services and are
the group that benefits the least from social protection
and safety net interventions. However, they are one
of the most vulnerable groups in society. The needs
and priorities of PWDs are not mainstreamed into the
design and implementation of such programmes.
• There is no Expanded Core Education Curriculum for
blind or visually impaired students. This causes many
disabled children to miss school because of a lack
of qualified teachers, relevant curricula, and other
infrastructure that could facilitate inclusive education
at schools.
• Generally, disabled women, children, the elderly, and
people with HIV/AIDS face more social, economic,
and political exclusion. Women suffer from engendered
inequalities due to cultural, religious, and traditional
dogmas. Disability increases the vulnerability
of these groups to sexual harassment, exploitation,
and poverty. Moreover, the organisations representing
PWDs are male-dominated, and the voices
of these groups are not included in their decision
making, advancing their marginalization.
17.7 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Outcome 2: Barriers that exclude People with
Disabilities (PWDs) are challenged to ensure their
inclusion and participation in their communities.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Promoting inclusive and equitable social services for
PWDs to fully participate in their communities’ social,
economic, and political activities.
2. Challenging harmful attitudes and discriminatory behaviour
PWDs. MESAF will work with development
partners to promote and design interventions that
address discriminatory behaviours, attitudes, and
perceptions against people with disabilities.
3. Drafting, reviewing, and enacting legal frameworks
that advance the rights of PWDs.
4. Strengthening coordination structures to address
challenges PWDs face in fully participating in social,
economic, and political activities.
17.8 Displacement Affected
Communities (DACs)
Somaliland is situated in the Horn of Africa, where disasters,
conflicts, and violence continue to cause immense
suffering. Significant conflicts in neighbouring countries
drive instability, which triggers forced displacement and
long-term disruption within societies and creates massive
humanitarian needs. Climate change, recurrent droughts,
and other climatic shocks in Somaliland and the wider
region also create internal displacement and refugees.
A broader range of vulnerabilities emerges due to the
disruptive effects of disasters, conflicts, and violence,
raising additional humanitarian needs. Somaliland is a
transit route, departure point, and destination for people
moving through the East Africa region. Every year, tens of
thousands of refugees and migrants travel to Somaliland
for safety and better opportunities. Many of these people
(including Somalis) travel through Somaliland on their way
to other destinations, including perilous journeys to the
Middle East, Europe, and North America.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 120
In Somaliland, the leading causes of displacement are a
result of violent conflict, insecurity, and droughts which
are linked to climate change. Variation in climatic factors
directly influences conflicts that force people to flee from
conflict-prone areas. As indicated by the multi-sector Internally
Displaced Person (IDP) needs assessment report (December
2021) conducted by the National Displacement and
Refugee Agency (NDRA), 183 IDP camps in Somaliland host
92,888 households (557,328 total persons). This includes
protracted IDPs for which finding durable solutions has
become increasingly difficult. In the last two decades, irregular
migration (Tahrib) has been a common phenomenon in
Somaliland and the wider region, particularly impacting the
youth population. Many Somalilanders become stranded
between their departure point and destination. Since 2018,
the NDRA assisted the return and reintegration of 5,056
citizens (2,878 male, 2,178 female).
Somaliland is positioned along two primary routes for
mixed movements: (a) the northern route towards North
Africa through Ethiopia and often Sudan and Libya; and (b)
the eastern route to the Arabian Peninsula, via Bosaaso
in Puntland or Djibouti to Yemen. Since 2011, Somaliland’s
coastal town of Berbera has also served as a port of entry
for (primarily) Yemeni and Syrian refugees and Somali and
Ethiopian returnees fleeing conflict in Yemen and Syria. As
of 2022, Somaliland registered 9,490 refugees and 7,422
asylum seekers. Of these refugees, 64 percent were Ethiopian
and 30 percent Yemeni, while the rest were either
Syrians or Eritreans.
Although government institutions have managed to handle
the influx of refugees, asylum seekers, and IDPs to an
extent, the human resource capacities, systems, infrastructure,
and financial resources to achieve durable solutions
for these populations are either absent or minimal, resulting
in violations of their rights.
Article 8 of Somaliland’s constitution obliges that all citizens
shall enjoy equal rights and obligations in the practice
of the law and shall not be accorded precedence on the
grounds of colour, clan, birth, language, gender, property,
status, opinion, etc. This article also indicates that foreigners
who have legal residence shall enjoy equal rights and
obligations before the law, except for political rights reserved
for citizens. Article 10 of the constitution also reads
that “the Republic of Somaliland recognises and shall act in
conformity with the United Nations Charter and with the international
law and shall respect the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights.”
The social pillar of the Somaliland National Vision 2030
envisages “a caring society meeting the basic social needs
of its members”. The vision addresses marginalized groups’
economic and social vulnerabilities, including displacement-
affected communities. The IDPs Policy (2015) aims to
achieve durable solutions and create an enabling environment
to uphold the rights and entitlements of IDPs during
all phases of displacement. Refugees and asylum seekers’
guidelines and regulations also protect the rights of these
populations and are enshrined in the country’s laws and
international treaties.
In January 2022, the NDRA launched its five years Strategic
Plan (2022-2026). It is the strategy that NDRA will use
to guide resources, programmes, policies, and operations.
This strategic plan is based on and aligned with NDP III, the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the national policy
on IDPs, the displacement guiding principles of Somaliland,
and international laws.
A refugee bill (2022) has been drafted by the legislative
bodies to become enacted into law, which will set out
Somaliland’s approach to refugees entering the country.
It is also notable that the parliament recently approved
the Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants Act
(LN.101/2021).In collaboration with UN Agencies and international
NGOs, the Migration Response Centre (MRC)
under NDRA provides services to migrants on legal documentation,
psychosocial counselling, and awareness raising,
among others. The MRC and the Mixed Migration Task
Force (MMTF), a working group of government institutions,
coordinate national advocacy campaigns on the risks of
illegal migration and human trafficking, as well other policy
actions addressing this issue.
The Government of Somaliland established the Refugees
Status Determination Committee that decides who
should be granted refugee and asylum seeker status. In
collaboration with stakeholders, the NDRA introduced and
implemented a comprehensive verification and biometric
registration system. It also issues identification cards for legally
registered refugees and asylum seekers. No refugee
camps are established in Somaliland, allowing refugees
and asylum seekers to have freedom of movement across
the country.
In partnership with UNHCR and other development and
humanitarian partners, the Government of Somaliland carries
out projects ranging from lifesaving and basic social
services to awareness-raising, sanitation, and hygiene and
social protection, forming durable solutions designed to
address the needs of refugees and asylum seekers.
The Protection Cluster brings together national and international
actors to make critical decisions impacting displacement-
affected communities. IDP camp management and
coordination committees and refugee committees closely
work with relevant authorities and development partners.
The NDRA also leads high-level intra-governmental coordination
meetings in which many government institutions
and security offices discuss issues related to immigration.
The Somaliland government recently drafted a mixed migration
management strategic plan, which will be in line
with the NDP III and support the management and protection
of mixed migrants.
17.9 DACs: Challenges and Key
Issues
There are a variety of challenges facing Displacement Affected
Communities (DACs)
• Displaced people move into cities that cannot properly
absorb them, forcing DACs to set up structures
on private land where they are evicted or constantly
threatened with eviction. This undermines efforts to
find durable solutions for DACs in Somaliland.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 121
• IDP camps are congested and informal settlements
where access to basic services like health, water,
shelter, and food is absent or extremely limited. This
negatively affects the wellbeing of people, particularly
women, girls, and PWDs.
• In the case of protracted IDPs, displaced people do
not return to their places of origin and struggle to
integrate into the host communities, making it challenging
to achieve durable solutions.
• DACs face protection challenges and increased gender-
based violence. Women and girls are vulnerable
to various risks, including rape, sexual harassment,
and other forms of violence, since they do not have
permanent shelters.
• Increased droughts linked to climate change are
accelerating land degradation while limiting the
available coping mechanisms of communities, which
forces them to move and compete for scarce resources.
17.10 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Outcome 3: Increased resilience of Displacement
Affected Communities by ensuring equitable access
to public services and sustainable livelihoods.
The National Displacement and Refugee Agency will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Empowering DACs through small business development.
In collaboration with humanitarian and development
partners, NDRA will provide small grants
to small businesses, particularly women-owned
businesses, and link them to financial institutions for
loans with minimum requirements.
2. Providing cash transfers and other essential assistance
to the most vulnerable households in DACs.
3. Ensuring access to basic public services, such as
healthcare, education (particularly TVET), water, sanitation,
hygiene, and shelter.
Outcome 4: Longer lasting and more sustainable
solutions have been found for Displacement Affected
Communities.
The National Displacement and Refugee Agency will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Facilitating the voluntary repatriation of refugees
and irregular migrants. NDRA will work with IOM,
UNHCR, Somaliland immigration authorities, neighbouring
countries, and other mandated institutions
to develop and implement repatriation programmes
for refugees and irregular migrants voluntarily returning
to their countries of origin or relocating to third
countries.
2. Supporting interventions for IDPs who voluntarily
choose to return to their areas of origin to restart
their livelihoods. NDRA will work with humanitarian
and development partners to assist in the voluntary
return of people in IDP camps to their traditional or
alternative livelihood basis.
3. Assisting IDPs, refugees and returnees who choose
to integrate into the host communities to establish
and enjoy their livelihoods.
4. Facilitating sustainable resettlement for IDPs who
choose to relocate to another region of the country.
NDRA will develop resettlement programmes and
mobilise resources for IDPs willing to settle in locations
in the country other than their place of origin.
The agency will ensure the smooth transition of the
IDPs into host communities.
5. Strengthening the monitoring and evaluation, counselling,
advisory services, and orientation and awareness
campaigns for vulnerable groups within DACs.
6. Advocating for the rights of DACs and devising appropriate
awareness-raising campaigns to mitigate
violence against refugees, asylum seekers and IDPs.
7. Strengthening the documentation and registration
system for DACs. NDRA will develop an online database
to capture information on displacement-affected
people that informs the design of interventions
that facilitates durable solutions.
8. Improving the case management system for DACs to
facilitate access and utilisation of available services.
9. Developing a one-stop-shop toolkit for IDPs, refugees
and asylum seekers that consolidates the
rights they are entitled to, including legal and social
services.
10. Strengthening the coordination mechanisms to protect
DACs. NDRA will strengthen and scale up the
coordination mechanisms, including with relevant
stakeholders.
11. Strengthening the capacity of the NDRA to provide
effective and efficient services to DACs.
12. Reviewing, formulating, and enforcing the policies
and legal frameworks that protect the rights of DACs
and strengthen law enforcement capacities and
mechanisms.
13. Ensuring the implementation of mixed migration
management strategic plan priorities.
17.11 Children’s Rights
Children are among the most vulnerable people in the
community due to their specific socio-economic circumstances.
The most vulnerable include children who live on
the street, refugee and migrant children, victims of crime,
those who are displaced or orphaned and children whose
parents cannot care for them.
Approximately 30 percent of Somaliland children are fostered,
with four percent having lost both parents and 12
percent having lost one parent. 36 percent of fostered and/
or orphaned children live in urban areas compared to 21
percent who are nomadic (SLHDS 2020). Children often
face sexual, physical, and psychological violence at home,
in school, and in other social settings. Although prohibited
in Article 24 of Somaliland’s constitution, and via the
Juvenile Justice Act and the Teachers’ Code of Conduct,
corporal punishment is still widely used in schools and
communities in Somaliland. The situation is more rampant
in Quranic schools.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 122
Although Somaliland labour law (31/2004) prohibits child
labour, more than 13 percent of children (ages 5-14) engage
in child labour (Employment and Labour Market Analysis
2019). The rate is higher for rural children compared to
those that live in urban areas. Higher poverty levels could
be a major driving factor of child labour, as the rate is lower
for children of educated mothers and wealthier households.
Early marriage and, to a certain extent, child marriage are
common in Somaliland. Survey data shows that 12 percent
of women married at the age of 15, 39 percent at the age
of 20, and 52 percent at the age of 22. Among men, five
percent married at the age of 18, while 11 and 23 percent
are married at the age of 20 and 22, respectively, (SLHDS
2020). Early and child marriage impedes prospects for
higher education and decent living standards. Moreover,
child marriage also poses health risks during childbirth.
Survey data shows a Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) prevalence
rate of 98 percent in Somaliland, which is among
the highest in the world. Traditional practitioners and birth
attendants often perform FGM without anaesthesia and
under unsanitary conditions. However, there has been a
“medicalisation” of the practice in urban areas and among
affluent people who enlist the services of healthcare professionals.
Increased awareness levels have resulted in the
decline of some forms of FGM, but entirely abandoning the
practice is still a long-term challenge.
National laws, policies, and children’s rights conventions
promote and protect children’s rights by establishing a
protective environment for children in Somaliland, where
girls and boys should be free from violence, neglect, and
exploitation. Article 19 of the constitution guarantees that
the state shall be responsible for the health, care, development,
and education of the mother and the child, as well
as those who are disabled or experiencing mental health
issues. National legal frameworks that advance children’s
rights include the Child Rights Act (No.102/2021), the Child
Protection Policy (2015) the Juvenile Justice Act (36/2007),
the Teachers’ Code of Conduct (2012), the Child Alternative
Care Policy, the Somaliland Labour Law (31/2020) and the
National Gender Policy (2019).
In partnership with development partners during NDP II,
MESAF developed and implemented child-sensitive social
safety nets for children in orphanages and those who live
on the street. MESAF also sensitizes communities about
child rights, manages orphanages, rehabilitates children
who live on the street and transfers children whose parents
could not take care of them to foster houses. Due to limited
institutional and financial capacity, a significant number of
children still lack fundamental rights, such as education,
food, shelter, and clean water.
17.12 Children’s Rights: Challenges
and Key Issues
Children in Somaliland face numerous challenges.
• Schools continue to use corporal punishment as a
form of discipline against children. Corporal punishment
is commonly administered for many reasons,
including absence from school, insubordination,
fighting with classmates, bullying, not doing homework
exercises and not obeying school rules. Corporal
punishment is practiced in urban and rural areas,
although the trend is decreasing specifically in urban
areas. Corporal punishment is rooted in long-standing
traditional norms that indicate it is acceptable
and desirable. Although there have been regulations
against corporal punishment, teachers generally do
not know alternate, non-violent forms of discipline.
• Children need to access adequate recreational
spaces and playgrounds, specifically in urban areas.
Physical education is also a low priority in schools,
due to a lack of recognition of its importance in
child development and perhaps due to its absence
in teacher training. This is manifested in the lack of
equipment and recreational spaces in schools and
residential areas.
• There is a significant number of children dropping out
of school. Key issues that lead to dropouts include
financial difficulty with paying for school fees and
services, girls needing to support their mothers with
household chores, and limited access to schools in
rural areas. In recent years, dropout rates have worsened
in rural areas due to recurrent droughts where
pastoral and agro-pastoralist communities move in
search of water and pasture for their animals.
• Children with disabilities suffer most when social
services are not responsive to their needs and priorities.
Children’s access to basic healthcare and public
services is limited in rural areas. Children suffer from
malnutrition in some areas due to their parents’ limited
access to social services and lack of awareness
of available support.
• FGM is prevalent in Somaliland. Girls who undergo
FGM are at risk of infection, birth complications,
bleeding and even death. Girls are also vulnerable
to mental health disorders, dropping out of school
and reduced growth and development, limiting their
future livelihoods.
• There is an increasing incidence of rape against
children in both urban and rural areas. Rape is a
significant crime under customary, sharia, and formal
laws. Although rape cases resolved through the legal
justice system have been increasing, most incidences
are still solved through customary law in which
traditional leaders settle the issue by denying full
justice to the victim.
17.13 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Outcome 5: Relevant institutional, policy and legal
frameworks are strengthened to protect children’s
rights.
The Ministry of Employment, Social Affairs, and Family will
achieve this outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Reviewing, drafting, and enacting national legal
and policy frameworks that protect and promote
children’s rights. MESAF will coordinate and ensure
the enactment of the draft children’s rights policy and
formulate new ones where necessary.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 123
2. Supporting and facilitating the establishment of functioning
child protection structures that protect the
rights of vulnerable children. MESAF will review and
capacitate the existing children’s rights protection
structures and facilitate the initiation of new ones
across the country.
3. Establishing a comprehensive and user-friendly
digital data management system that informs plans,
decisions, policies, and interventions that advance
children’s rights.
4. Strengthening the capacity of community-based
structures protecting children’s rights, particularly in
remote and rural areas where formal children’s rights
mechanisms do not exist.
5. Undertaking targeted assessments and research
on the status of children’s rights to make informed
policy decisions and design relevant programme
interventions.
6. Enhancing youth knowledge of sexual and reproductive
health and rights (SRHRs) and the impacts of
early child marriage in urban and rural areas. MESAF
will collaborate with human rights activists and community
structures to address child and early marriage
in Somaliland.
17.14 Youth
Somaliland youth share traits with other developing states
where underdevelopment is an enormous challenge. The
Somaliland National Youth Policy defines the term “youth’
as persons aged 15 to 35 years, which also complies with
the African Youth Charter. According to the Population
Estimation Survey (PESS), 72 percent of Somaliland’s
population is below the age of 35 years. Furthermore,
Somaliland is experiencing a “youth bulge” – a situation
that, if not address, could undermine the country’s peace
and stability. Many young individuals are neither in school
nor employed, and even those seeking further education
cannot be certain that they will have future employment
opportunities.
The youth unemployment rate for Borama is 69 percent
for urban areas and 62 percent for rural areas. Hargeisa’s
youth unemployment rate is 34 percent for urban areas
and 41 percent for rural areas. Burao has a youth unemployment
rate of 46 in urban areas and 53 percent in rural
areas. (Labour Force Survey 2012).
The mismatch between local university courses and labour
market demands is a critical driver of youth unemployment.
Another obstacle is the prejudicial attitude towards technical
education, where many people do not consider technical
courses as prestigious as university courses, reducing
the demand for TVET.
Rampant unemployment leads many Somaliland youth to
risk their lives via migration (Tahrib), where they can find
themselves at risk of torture and kidnapping for ransom by
cartels. In addition, a large percentage of unskilled youth
may resort to criminal activities and are vulnerable to drug
addiction. A lack of employment also leads youth to early
marriage, with the problem being more chronic in rural
settings.
Addressing the challenges facing youth is a cross-cutting
issue in which many public institutions have a stake, such
as MESAF, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of
Education and Science, and Somaliland Youth Development
Fund. Youth issues are covered in the following policies
and legislations: the National Youth Policy (2018-2021), the
National Employment Policy (2020), the National Internship
Policy (2019), the Somaliland Labour Act (31/2020), and the
Civil Service Act (97/2022).
The Somaliland National Vision 2030 prioritises youth
development under its Social Development pillar, where
youth unemployment and emigration are particularly emphasised.
The overall goal of the National Youth Policy is
to attain an empowered youth that contribute positively to
national development. The priority areas outlined in this
policy are education and skills development; employment
creation and economic development; health and well-being;
recreation and sports; and information, communication,
and technology, among other areas.
The government of Somaliland established the Somaliland
Youth Development Fund (SLYD) in 2020 to address
unemployment through improved access to finance, entrepreneurship
promotion, and skills training. The Fund is
currently developing strategic and operational documents
to address the critical challenges facing youth through investments
in entrepreneurship, which is a critical driver for
accelerated socio-economic development. In collaboration
with private financial institutions and development partners,
SLYDF will enable young entrepreneurs to access finance,
legal advice, market information, business skills development,
and business-to-business linkages. The SLYDF will
facilitate business co-creation bootcamps and public business
pitch platforms in all the regions of the country.
The National Internship Policy sets out guidelines for supporting
unemployed youth graduates with opportunities to
gain practical work experience and bridge skills between
academics and the demands of the labour market, ultimately
contributing to increased youth employment and
Somaliland’s development.
The government of Somaliland introduced a national service
programme that recruits university graduates on a
merit basis. This programme creates jobs for many young
graduates and reduces youth unemployment. Through
three-to-six months of intensive training, youth are placed
in positions in the armed forces or in various MDAs. However,
this programme will require an innovative strategy to
improve its sustainability as the public sector will require
increased capacity to absorb more graduates.
To create an enabling environment for youth, the Ministry
of Youth and Sports, with the help of development partners,
established youth centres to promote integration and enable
them to build their job skills. Youth centres also provide
peer-to-peer learning, networking opportunities and
encourage the growth of positive self-esteem. The MESAF
has established an Employment and Training Directorate
that supports job creation for youth and vulnerable groups,
including women and minorities, to tackle unemployment.
The Directorate has a job centre which provides services
such as training for interviews and basic employment exRepublic
of Somaliland National Development Plan III 124
pectations, support for developing resumes and CVs, and
trainings on entrepreneurship. In addition, with the financial
support of international agencies, several local organisations
offer TVET courses geared towards preparing youth
for the labour market.
Led by the Ministry of Communication and in partnership
with Taiwan’s International Cooperation and Development
Fund (ICDF), the e-Government Capability Enhancement
Project and Technology manages an innovation zone – the
first of its kind in Somaliland – which serves as an ICT training
hub for public servants and citizens.
17.15 Youth: Challenges and Key
Issues
Somaliland youth face several critical challenges:
• Unemployment remains the most significant challenge
confronting youth. The high level of unemployment
often leads to harmful coping mechanisms,
such as drug abuse, illegal migration, and even
violent conflict.
• There is a mismatch between the knowledge and
skills youth attain at universities and the job market’s
demands, which increases youth unemployment.
Evidence suggests skills acquired through TVET
programmes are in high demand in the labour market,
as opposed to social and business management
degrees.
• Although youth make up the majority of Somaliland’s
population, they have limited presence in critical
decision-making structures in the government, even
though these decisions directly affect their future.
• Due to the high level of unemployment, an increasing
number of youths illegally migrate through Ethiopia,
Sudan, and Libya on their way to Europe. The journey
can be perilous, and smugglers frequently expose
migrants to life-threatening risks and violence. An
increasing number of migrants have also lost their
lives crossing the ocean, while others have died due
to a lack of food and water.
17.16 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Outcome 6: Increased resilience and socio-economic
participation of Somaliland’s youth.
The Somaliland Youth Development Fund, in collaboration
with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Increasing youth self-employment through business
management and entrepreneurial trainings and the
provision of business seed funding.
2. Improving youth employability and access to job markets
through coordination and partnerships among
key stakeholders to match skills with the demands of
the job market.
3. Increasing resource mobilisation by establishing a
public-private fund or investment venture to fund
youth business initiatives and reduce unemployment.
The Ministry of Youth and Sports (MoYS) will achieve this
outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Producing a framework that facilitates and nurtures
youth innovation and talents, such as through
innovation labs and platforms where young people
can showcase their entrepreneurial talents.
2. Improving existing recreational facilities and coordinating
with local governments to allocate land
for new facilities across the country. The MoYS will
allocate adequate resources for maintaining the existing
recreational centres and lobby local councils to
provide land for new spaces.
3. Expanding and operationalising youth centres to the
six regional capitals of the country. The MoYS will
work with development partners to scale up existing
youth centres and establish new ones where necessary.
4. Developing and implementing advocacy strategies
on issues that affect youth participation in democratic
governance at all levels. MoYS will collaborate
with SYDF, MESAF, and CSOs in promoting youth
participation in Somaliland’s democratic processes.
5. Developing youth migration and response programmes
that address the underlying causes of
migration, including unemployment.
6. Creating community awareness campaigns against
youth violence. MoYS will develop awareness-raising
interventions to prevent youth from engaging in violence
and drug-related crimes.
7. Conducting periodic coordination meetings with
youth development stakeholders to share information
on challenges and opportunities impacting
youth development programmes and projects.
8. Enhancing the capacity of the MoYS to deliver youth
development programmes effectively. The MoYS will
develop relevant policy frameworks, enhance the
technical and managerial capacities of the staff and,
where necessary, recruit new talent.
17.17 HIV/AIDs
Somaliland has one of the lowest HIV/AIDs infection rates
in Africa, which is typical of a highly religious and culturally
close-knit society. The prevalence rate of HIV has been declining
persistently, as revealed by comparative antenatal
care surveys, dropping from 1.4 percent in 2004 to only .15
percent in 2018.
HIV/AIDS prevention programmes have continued to
operate with different levels of coverage. The Somaliland
National AIDS Commission (SOLNAC) has a strategy for
integrating HIV/AIDs education into the national school
curriculum and coordinates with the Ministry of Education
and Science to improve knowledge and awareness and
reduce social stigmas against people living with HIV/AIDS.
To achieve WHO targets, the HIV testing rate in Somaliland
has increased significantly. Key services include preventing
mother-to-child transmission (MTCT), HIV testing and counselling,
blood safety, tissue transfusion safety, pre- and
post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP/PEP), and HIV prevention
commodities.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 125
The number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) on antiretroviral
therapy (ART) increased from 2,671 in 2016 to 3,371 in
2019 in Somaliland, owing to expanded testing facilities. To
improve treatment commencement and adherence rates,
“Test and Treat” protocols were introduced. Linkages and
referral systems between health facilities, community outreach,
and PLHIV networks have also been improved.
The number of viral load machines installed and used for
testing has increased, leading to viral load coverage reaching
37.5 percent in 2019. As a result, more PLHIV now live
longer due to increased ART coverage, with a retention
rate of 74.8 percent.
The draft National HIV/AIDs Policy (2023) envisions Somaliland
where HIV and AIDS are eliminated. This policy
aims to create an enabling environment for the development
and execution of effective and efficient HIV and AIDS
interventions and for achieving epidemic control. The
country’s National Vision 2030 stipulates a multi-sectoral
response to reduce the number of new infections and provide
care and support to those in need. The national HIV/
AIDs strategic plan also intends to strengthen the health
delivery system and enhance the network of service delivery
points at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. This
will improve HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support
services to all population groups, especially high-risk and
vulnerable groups.
HIV/AIDS response is a cross-cutting and multi-sectoral,
which should be mainstreamed into the broader development
strategies. SOLNAC organises a quarterly coordination
platform for multi-sector focal points, PLHIV network
representatives, national and international NGOs, and bilateral
and multilateral partners to review progress, monitor
responses, and address challenges. In addition, SOLNAC
produces national HIV quarterly data (2018-2021) on ART,
HIV testing, annual new HIV cases and HIV/AIDS mortality.
Despite coordinated efforts, a large percentage of people
in Somaliland have limited awareness of HIV/AIDS. Although
improving, there is still limited capacity for coordination
and monitoring within HIV services and programmes
and between other health and broader development
programmes. The stigma against people living with the
disease and retention in ART remains a challenge, primarily
due to a lack of social support (food, transport) and stigma.
The unemployment rate among PLHIV is generally high,
with about 72.4 percent not engaged in any form of employment,
which exacerbates the poor living conditions of
the affected people. Increased poverty and overcrowded
IDP camps increase opportunities for HIV transmission, as
well as other diseases.
17.18 HIV/AIDS: Challenges and Key
Issues
There are several challenges facing Somaliland for HIV/
AIDS response:
• There are limited human resources to operate prevention,
treatment, and care services.
• The monitoring and evaluation of HIV/AIDS responses
has been a challenge, including low quality
reporting.
• The coordination and management of response
programmes have yet to be effective, resulting in
fragmented interventions with limited impact.
• Stigma and discrimination are prevalent and impede
access to and utilisation of HIV/AIDS services, particularly
for those residing in rural areas and key
affected populations.
17.19 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Outcome 7: Reduced HIV/Aids incidence, prevalence,
and mortality by increasing access to information
and testing and treatment centres.
The Somaliland National AIDS Commission will achieve this
outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Expanding HIV/AIDs counselling services, testing
centres, and access to ART in all regions.
2. Raising community awareness of HIV/AIDS transmission
methods and preventive mechanisms. SOLNAC
will scale up awareness programmes for HIV/AIDS
risk groups and communities in all regions.
3. Expanding the number of HIV/AIDs treatment centres
to reduce the impact of TB and other related
complications. SOLNAC will increase the number of
HIV/AIDS therapeutic centres, including treating disease
patients and providing access to life-sustaining
drugs and other essential services.
4. Improving the nutritional and economic status of
PLHIV. SOLNAC, in collaboration with development
partners, will provide food and invest in income-generation
activities for PLHIV.
5. Developing, reviewing, and enacting the HIV/AIDs
policy and regulatory frameworks that facilitate effective
responses.
6. Improving research, M&E, and data management
systems to inform policy decisions.
7. Strengthening the capacities of SOLNAC and its staff
to better design, monitor and implement response
interventions.
Outcome 8: Reduced HIV/AIDs-related stigma and
discrimination.
The Somaliland National AIDS Commission will achieve this
outcome through the following priority interventions:
1. Increasing awareness and sensitization in communities
and medical facilities to reduce HIV/AIDs related
stigmas and discrimination.
2. Integration of HIV/AIDS awareness in all levels of the
educational system. SOLNAC will work with MESAF,
the Ministry of Education and Sciences (MoES) and
private education service providers to ensure an education
system that is responsive to the needs and
priorities of PLHIV.
17.20 Rural Development
Nomadic pastoralism is the traditional - and most viable -
land management and production system in Somaliland. It
has adapted to the erratic climate conditions of the Horn of
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 126
Africa’s drylands by providing and conserving an extensive
array of ecosystem services through dynamic, flexible, and
complex structures. Somaliland is categorized as having
arid and semi-arid ecosystems, suitable primarily for sheep,
goat, and camel rearing in common rangelands. Livestock
remains one of the country’s major economic activities,
bringing much-needed foreign currency. Somaliland exports
live animals instead of chilled meat. This practice is
vulnerable to external shocks, such as frequent importation
bans from the Gulf countries, mainly Saudi Arabia.
Somaliland’s rural communities have limited access to
quality social services such as education, health, sanitation,
and water. For instance, nomadic pastoralism is a critical
challenge in the education sector due to constant mobility
and the scarcity of trained teachers willing to serve in rural
villages (ESSP 2022-2026). According to the 2020 Somaliland
Health and Demographic Survey (SLHDS), rural women
face acute problems in accessing healthcare. The SLHDS
shows that mothers from urban areas have better access
to qualified birth attendants than women living in rural and
nomadic areas.
Due to the climate, water is very scarce in the country.
Nearly 60 percent of the rural population does not have
access to safe drinking water in Somaliland and daily
water consumption per person is well below international
standards for healthy living. The water situation is further
worsened by poor sustainable management and improper
operation and maintenance of water sources in rural areas
(Water Sector Strategic Plan 2022–2024).
It is estimated that the country has 350,000 hectares of
arable land, situated mainly in the northwestern plateau
where farmers grow rain-fed sorghum, maize, sesame, watermelon,
and beans. Cash crops are grown in small plots
along dry rivers. Crop production is constrained by multiple
socioeconomic, biophysical, and technical factors. Access
to quality water in sufficient quantities is the most significant
determining factor of crop production. Other issues
include poor land management, inappropriate technology,
inadequate support services (extension, early warning systems,
and credit), incoherent policies, poor infrastructure,
and limited value addition.
In both pastoral and agropastoral ecozones, the effect of
land degradation and extreme weather conditions cause
food insecurity and rural-urban drift. Cyclic droughts decimate
a large percentage of livestock, cause crop failures,
and displace rural households to IDP camps around the
main towns. Gender is generally considered a critical
determinant of poverty and access to services. According
to the 2015 Poverty Profile Report, female-headed households
are more likely to be poor compared to male-headed
households.
Consequently, scarce natural resources cause inter-clan
and inter-familial disputes. To cope with the situation, rural
households rely on humanitarian responses, grab portions
of communal lands to conserve fodder, grow crops for food
and fodder, and turn to tree cutting for charcoal production.
The Somaliland population relies heavily on imported food
and other essential commodities. Regular price increases
affect the ability of an average household to rely solely on
market purchases. Moreover, many households’ meagre
resources are wasted on Khat consumption, leaving little for
essential household needs such as education and health.
The Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) was established
by presidential decree in November 2021 with the mandate
of coordinating rural development efforts to ensure that
Somaliland’s rural communities enjoy a quality of life amidst
recurrent droughts and other change-induced shocks. Its
core duties and responsibilities include preparing and
implementing a national rural development policy, creating
plans to improve and maintain the livelihoods of rural
communities, and coordinating rural development projects
within government and non-governmental organisations to
prevent the duplication of efforts.
The new ministry has a five-year strategic plan (2023-2025),
which outlines the implementation arrangements of its core
responsibilities. In addition, the MoRD will apply national
water, agriculture, employment, environmental, health, and
education policies and strategic plans, promoting integrated
approaches whenever this is likely to result in improved
efficiency, efficacy, and impact. Advances in information
technology, including extensive mobile networks with
internet access, community grazing reserves, commercial
camel dairy production, increasing greenhouse production,
and fodder, soil, and water conservation - as well as
unsatiated demands for livestock and crop products - are
opportunities for the new ministry to realize its mandate.
17.21 Rural Development:
Challenges and Key Issues
In the absence of a specific thematic focus, the MoRD
collaborates with other public institutions and humanitarian
partners in addressing rural priorities and challenges,
including:
• Diversifying sources of income for the majority of
rural households, which overly depend on a single
economic source, i.e., nomadic pastoralism or subsistent
farming.
• Promoting innovative “climate-smart” approaches in
rural development in the face of droughts and other
climatic variables likely becoming more frequent and
prolonged.
• Community-led sustainable natural resource management
to:
• Avoid unregulated land grabbing and conflicts
over territorial control and land demarcations.
• Combat the degradation of rangelands and
farmlands, such as when indigenous plants are
replaced with unpalatable exotic species such
as Prosopis juliflora and parthenium weeds.
• Preventing and mitigating desert locust infestation,
and epidemic human and livestock diseases in the
absence of adequate social services.
17.22 NDP III Outcomes and Priority
Interventions
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 127
Outcome 9: Sustainable livelihoods of rural
communities enhanced through integrated
interventions to achieve food security.
The Ministry of Rural Development will achieve this outcome
through the following priority interventions:
1. Undertaking research on pull factors to urban centres
and assess rural non-farm (RNF) business opportunities.
MoRD will carry out rural community needs
assessments for advocacy with relevant stakeholders,
as well as investigating motives for pastoral and
agro-pastoralist communities to move from rural to
urban centres for better opportunities.
2. Enhancing adaptation capacities of pastoral communities
through livestock destocking and restocking
programmes. MoRD will work with public institutions
and development partners to promote programmes
that, on the one hand, support culling weak animals
that may not survive in droughts and, on the other
hand, restocking when the situation is favourable.
3. Building agribusiness skills through training the
youth to enhance the income generating capacity of
rural households. In collaboration with SYDF, MoYS,
and MESAF, the MoRD will promote youth entrepreneurship
skills in agribusiness value chains in agropastoral
districts.
4. Promoting women’s entrepreneurship and access
and control over resources in rural areas, through
self-help groups and cooperatives. The MoRD will
establish and strengthen the capacities of self-help
groups to champion women’s entrepreneurship.
5. Designing and implementing climate adaptation and
resilience interventions to strengthen rural communities’
capacity and ability to anticipate, cope with,
and recover from disasters and shocks. This includes
increasing the awareness of rural communities about
the risks of climate change and adaptation strategies
through media programmes.
6. Investing in social protection initiatives for vulnerable
groups, particularly women and girls, the elderly,
PWDs and children in rural areas, in collaboration
with MESAF.
7. In collaboration with the Ministry of Livestock and
Fishery Development (MoLFD), conducting a study
on sustainable systems of livestock production in
the face of increasing climate variables that threaten
the traditional pastoralist and agro-pastoralist livelihoods.
8. Establishing coordination platforms for public and
non-public institutions on addressing the root causes
of rural development issues.
9. Developing and enforcing policy and legal instruments
that strengthen the rural development, recovery,
and resilience building framework.
10. Carrying out an institutional capacity assessment.
MoRD will address the institutional capacity gaps
based on the assessment outcome. This includes assessing
the need to increase the presence of MoRD
in all regions through the establishment of regional
offices.

RESOURCE MOBILISATION STRATEGY
Chapter 18
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 131
18.1 Introduction
This exercise analyses the myriad of financing available to
the country from different sources. It includes assessments
on the public sector resources of tax and non-tax revenues,
financial sector support to the private sector, private sector
flows, and Official Development Assistance (ODA) available
to support the development of Somaliland. The key findings
and recommendations are relevant to the implementation
of the National Development Plan III in terms of expected
financing sources and their magnitude, as well as reforms
that are crucial to set the country on a high and sustainable
growth path.
18.2 Overview of Somaliland’s
Finance Sector
The financial system in Somaliland consists of four shariah
compliant banks, 16 remittance companies, three microfinance
institutions (MFIs), five insurance companies and
three mobile money service providers. The banks operate
on Islamic banking rules, mainly accepting deposits and
giving loans to the public. MFIs also provide Sharia-compliant
financial services via loans to low-income segments
of society. Mobile money operators allow businesses and
households to conduct transactions (mainly digital). Additionally,
through international money transfer agents, they
offer remittance services.
Somaliland’s banking sector continues to grow, with assets
(mainly in US dollars) increasing by 64 percent between
2017 and December 2020, standing at US$290.6 million
in total. Equally, bank deposits increased substantially from
US$120.4 million in 2017 to US$291.1 million in 2020.
Somaliland’s banks remain fully capitalized with a capital
adequacy ratio at 12.9 percent as of December 2020. This
is above the Basel Committee recommended prudential
requirement of 10 percent. Furthermore, the sector remains
highly liquid to support economic activities, with the ratio of
liquid assets to total assets being above 80 percent since
2017 and reaching a high of 90 percent in December 2020.
This is above the prudential requirement of a minimum of
30 percent.
The banks support to the economy has been steadily growing
over time. Gross loans as of December 2020 stood at
US$184.3 million, up from US$49.7 million at the end 2017,
marking a growth of 271 percent. Private sector credit
growth, a universal indicator of business growth, grew 124
percent in 2020. The support to this sector could be further
strengthened.
In Somaliland, non-bank financing is provided by microfinance
institutions and mobile money financial services.
Both are expanding in volume and value, contributing to
the rapid expansion of the digital financial space.
MFI’s assets, capital, and income continue to grow, reflecting
their vibrance. Total capital grew by 21 percent to US$
6.8 million in December 2019, up from US$5.7 million the
previous year. MFIs registered growth in total assets rose
from US$7.4 million in 2018 to US$9.4 million in 2019. Similarly,
gross loans increased from US$6.0 million in 2018 to
US$7.5 million in 2019.
The Somaliland economy continues to be highly dollarised,
which affects the ability of the Central Bank to fulfil its
“lender of last resort” mandate. There is no inter-bank lending
(which can help provide additional liquidity), no national
payment system to allow for a clearance house, and limited
international trade finance. According to the Somaliland
Bankers Association, the percentage of unbanked people
is estimated at around 90 percent.
18.3 Domestic Public Revenue
Public finance reforms in both tax policy and administration
over the years have yielded positive results, albeit marginal.
Domestic revenue increased from 6.3 percent of GDP in
2016 to 7.8 percent in 2020, below the tax-revenue target
(a subset) of 13 percent in NDP II. This makes Somaliland
amongst the lowest performers in a comparable group of
selected East Africa and Horn of Africa countries, as depicted
in Figure 16.
International trade (customs) revenue is the major driving
force for domestic revenue mobilisation in Somaliland,
comprising almost half of the government’s revenue in
2020. While this figure shows the positive impacts of the
development of the Berbera port, it also poses a risk due
to the small revenue base. This figure is likely to increase
when the Berbera Corridor is fully completed. Conversely,
revenues from income taxes remains extremely low,
accounting for only five percent of total revenues. Taxes
on goods and services represent 18 percent of total revenues.
As this tax affects almost all economic transactions
in the country, it is clear there needs to be improvements
to efficiency. Overall, domestic revenue mobilisation faces
Figure 16: Tax revenue as a share of GDP, cross country comparison
Source: World Bank Development Indicators
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 132
the primary constraints of a narrow tax base and lack of
automation to improve compliance. The varying capacities
of different ministries to collect revenue continues to hinder
revenue collection and increases the non-tax revenue
base, especially on government properties.
18.4 Remittances
A significant portion of the population depends on remittances,
ranging from personal consumption to small
business support. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates
that almost one million Somalilanders live abroad, most of
whom are working and sending remittances back home. It
further estimates that over 300 micro, small, and medium
enterprises in Hargeisa alone are financed by the diaspora.
Data from the Central Bank of Somaliland shows that in
2020 Somalilanders received US$1.3 billion (45 percent of
GDP) in remittances. This constitutes a significant source
of development finance for the country, and hence the potential
of remittances should be of paramount importance.
18.5 Official Development
Assistance
Somaliland, based on World Bank definitions, is categorized
as a low-income country. In most cases, these countries
have social service (health and education) deficiencies and
infrastructure needs. The international community of development
partners raised funding, on behalf of the country,
to complement the government’s efforts. These funds flow
from bilateral partners and multilateral agencies, as well
as international non-governmental agencies (INGOs). A
breakdown of disbursements by partner category is shown
in Table 13.
UN Agency Interventions
The total amount disbursed by UN agencies is estimated
at US$140,052,496 for the year 2018. The bulk of which
went to the health sector, with WFP disbursing almost half
of these funds. Interventions to support livelihood activities
in the production sector were the next highest recipient
of the flows, followed by WASH and education. The FAO
and UNICEF are also actively involved in the production,
education, and WASH sectors.
International NGOs
The economic sector was the largest recipient of INGO
funds in 2018, as opposed to the health sector in the previous
year. This trend seems to be in line with the priority
intervention areas of UN agencies. Figure 18 shows the
distribution of INGO funds per sector

Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 133
18.6 Climate Finance
There are a variety of different channels for climate finance.
These range from bilateral and multilateral channels
to funds such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and the
Global Environment Facility (GEF). This also includes other
private and public investment funds and specific loans by
multilateral development banks and international financial
Institutions (IFIs). The role of the private sector in climate
finance is expected to grow in the coming years, including
from sources such as philanthropies and regional funds.
There are broad objectives for each funding source, but
they largely fall within the climate change objectives of adaptation,
mitigation, capacity building, and reducing emissions
from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD).
Presently, Somaliland is only benefiting from the GEF, with
UNDP as the implementing partner, on the programme
“Support for Integrated Water Resources Management to
Ensure Water Access and Disaster Reduction for Pastoralists”.
Given Somaliland’s vulnerability to climate-related risk such
as droughts, there is potentially abundant funding which
the country can access. Below, we present data on climate
finance in sub-Saharan Africa through multilateral agencies,
with a view to highlighting untapped sources.
Figure 19 shows the magnitude of projects approved for
sub-Saharan African countries between 2018 and 2020.
The GCF, the Least Developed Countries Fund, and the
Adaptation Fund are the ones with the largest support to
the region. The projects, however, are mostly implemented
through UN agencies, with very few projects directly executed
by the government.
18.7 Future Trends in Development
Financing for NDP III
Based on the performance of the economy and its relationship
with financing sources, this section projects the
flow of finance across the economy to support the development
of the economy for the next five years under “a
business-as-usual” scenario. A summary of the forecasting
technique used for all the variables is provided. However,
forecasting is largely constrained by a lack of data. The
forecasts in Table 16 show moderate improvements in total
financing available under existing scenarios. Worryingly,
Figure 18: INGO disbursement by sector
Figure 19: Multilateral climate fund approved projects
Source: Climate Change Update
Table 15: Financing sources and forecasting methods
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 134
the domestic revenues as a percentage GDP will still be
under 10 percent by 2027. With limited domestic financing,
the government will continue to be under-resourced to provide
the basic social services. Therefore, ODA is projected
to marginally increase during this period as the country
requires a steady flow of funds from partners. In total, it
is anticipated that development finance will reach US$2.6
billion by 2027.
18.8 NDP III Costing
Table 17 shows the estimated cost of all interventions for
NDP III. The total costs of priority interventions linked to
NDP III outcomes were estimated by sector experts. The
cost estimates by all MDAs under a sector were then combined
to constitute the total cost estimate of the sector.
The estimated total cost for NDP III is US$ 2,576,140,274.
Of these, infrastructure constitutes the highest share (36.78
percent of the total cost), followed by health (14.87 percent)
and education (12.95 percent). The interventions, in value,
are almost equally split between recurrent expenditures
and development expenditures, as shown in the Table 18
(the latter is slightly higher at 54.48 percent). As depicted
in Table 18, the plan frontloads most of the development
expenditures between 2024-2026.
18.9 Financing Gap Analysis
As mentioned previously, domestic revenues are anticipated
to grow, but potentially may still be below 10 percent
of total government revenues. ODA is expected to marginally
increase, based on forecasts from previous trends.
Nonetheless, the financing gap analysis reveals interesting
trends.
Due to a lack of sufficient data, committed resources from
development partners could not be quantified and the
financing gap analysis is presented in two scenarios:
• Scenario one: With donor inflows marginally increasing
from previous years, this means only two of the
five years of the NDP III will have a financing gap.
However, this requires a high level of coordination
and alignment between development partners and
the government.
• Scenario two: Assuming normal domestic resource
flows and poor coordination and non-alignment from
partners, there will be a financing deficit in all five
years of NDP III, totalling US$1.04 billion.
18.10 Strategies for Closing the
Funding Gap
Banking Sector Support to Investment
The banking sector shows an average of more than an 80
percent liquidity ratio against the standard of at least 30
percent, as required by the Basel Committee prudential requirements.
In contrast, access to finance continues to be
a challenge for the private sector, more so for women. The
government should incentivise bank lending to support
private sector growth and more access for women.
Often, the banking sector serves as a source of financing to
both the private sector and the government through money
markets. With a high level of liquidity, there is a need for
the necessary reforms to establish such a market in the
economy. Asset quality supervision should be improved,
especially around non-performing loans, ranging from their
estimation to provision. There is a need to strengthen the
Central Bank to address this risk.
There is currently no securities market in Somaliland. To a
large extent, this is attributable to the lack of conventional
commercial banking activity. The government, firms, and
households do not have access to trading in financial
assets. The ability of governments to raise money from
the domestic economy is fundamental to addressing the liquidity
constraints for financing much-needed investments.
This is of the utmost importance, in view of the limited
access to financing from multilateral financial institutions.
Introducing Islamic money markets is an opportunity to tap
into the vast network of possible diaspora financing for the
governments’ development agenda by investing in domestic
financial assets.
Domestic Resource Mobilisation
The Addis Ababa Accord on financing for development
affirms the commitment of African governments to improve
domestic resource mobilisation as a core component of
development finance. It is believed that domestic public
resources are a more stable and sustainable source of
income. To this end, domestic revenue as a proportion
of GDP continues to lag in Somaliland compared to the
sub-region, where it is recommended a rate of tax revenue
to GDP be at least 14 percent.
To address this issue and expand domestic resources, the
following reforms will be undertaken as part of the PFM
Strategy supported by the recently approved World Bank
Project on Enhancing Public Resource Management.
• Expanding the narrow tax base to reduce vulnerabilities
to the economy from external factors.
Table 16: Development finance projections, 2023-2027 (USD)
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 135
• Prioritising automation for customs and inland revenue
mobilisation, as iterated in the PFM Strategy,
with the long-term goal of establishing the Somaliland
Revenue Authority to increase efficiency and
compliance.
• Modifying the capital gains tax payment regime. The
current system negatively impacts compliance.
• Introducing frequent telecommunications tax audits
to improve compliance. This should be addressed
either through the upcoming public finance reform
or led by an outside firm.
• Applying the recommended WHO tax regime on
tobacco and other stimulants. This would combine a
specific excise tax and an ad valorem tax.
Foreign Direct Investment
As Somaliland still doesn’t have a system of national accounts,
there is no data on the flow of Foreign Direct Investment
(FDI) into the country. There should be deliberate
efforts to measure such a variable as it indicates both the
flow of much needed foreign currency and investor confidence
in the economy.
The Berbera Port Concession is a prime example of the
transformative impact FDI could play in an economy by
creating more jobs and revenue for the government.
Increased FDI flows could potentially support stand-alone
investments and or public-private partnerships. There is a
need to establish an Investment Promotion Agency for both
tourism promotion and export and investment promotions,
which is common for countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
Remittances
There will be clear policies to encourage the diaspora’s
continued participation in the economy, including attracting
diaspora financing. According to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Cooperation (MoFAIC), there are at
least 300 Somaliland diaspora businesses run in Hargeisa
alone. Without an expanded export base, remittance flows
will be necessary to keep the trade balance on a sustainable
path.
Climate Funds
There are very limited flows of climate funds into Somaliland
through multilateral agencies. As mentioned previously, the
bulk of these funds in the region are channelled through
UN agencies. A climate finance prospectus of projects will
be detailed for engagement with the UN agencies operating
in the country for possible resource mobilisation. The
agencies have the capacity and trust of the fund managers
to easily attract more funding. Bilateral and multilateral
investments, such as in renewable energy, should be prioritised
based on ease of access. A properly positioned
private sector could also benefit from the myriad of opportunities
for sustainable technologies, infrastructure, and
practices. These range from private investors and development
finance institutions (DFIs) and multilaterals such as
the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank’s
International Finance Corporation (IFC). Given Somaliland’s
vulnerability to climate related risks such as droughts, the
potential to access such funds is high. Table 20 shows an
overview of climate funding implementing agencies.
Each of these funding sources have different priorities.
Overall, the Global Climate Fund (GCF), the Least Development
Countries Fund (LDCF), and the Adaption Fund
(AF) are mainly focused on disaster risk reduction and
prevention, agriculture, environmental policy, water supply
and water policy, and rural development. To access these
funds it will be important to learn from these experiences
across the continent.
There are other actors in the region supporting private
sector development in general who are also active on
Table 18: Expenditure type, 2023-2027
Table 17: Total NDP III intervention cost by sector
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 136
sustainable investments in-line with climate change objectives,
coming from partner countries of Somaliland. These
include:
• The Nordic Development Fund (NDF), which is the
joint Nordic international finance institution focusing
on the nexus between climate change and development.
Presently, they extend loans in the Somali
region through Shuraako and Oxfam.
• The oldest DFI is the UK’s British International Investment
(formally CDC Group). It presently has a
US$7.1 billion portfolio consisting of 681 businesses,
of which 410 are in Africa, with an average annual
return of 6.1 percent.
• FMO is a Dutch development bank structured as
a bilateral private-sector international financial
institution based in the Hague, Netherlands. FMO
manages funds for the Ministries of Foreign Affairs
and Economic Affairs of the Dutch government to
maximize the development impact of private sector
investments
• IFU is a DFI owned by the Government of Denmark.
IFU is a self-governing, state-owned fund, whose
objective is to promote economic and social development
in developing countries.
• The European Investment Bank (EIB) is the lending
arm of the European Union. It is one of the biggest
multilateral financial institutions in the world and one
of the largest providers of climate finance.
• Proparco is a subsidiary of Agence Française de
Développement (AFD) and focused on private sector
development. It has been promoting sustainable
economic, social, and environmental development
practices for over 40 years.
Somaliland has the opportunity for regulatory reforms to
enable the private sector to partner with European counterparts
to access much needed funding from these sources.
18.11 Additional Tables on Financing
The four additional tables on the following pages present
the financing dynamics and requirements of all sectors in
Somaliland. The first table, “Overall revenues vs. expenditures”,
presents the financing gap analysis for all sectors
in two ways. First is an analysis of factors using only anticipated
domestic resource flows in the sector, based on
historical budget allocations. A second scenario is also
presented where official development assistance (ODA) is
factored in as an inflow into the sector. This shows the potential
benefits of improving aid coordination to align ODA
to the objectives of the NDP III.
The second table, “Sectors by expenditure type”, breaks
down the expenditure needs for all sectors into recurrent
and development expenditures.
The third table, “Expected sources of financing by sector”,
presents the expected financing sources of all planned expenditures
for the NDP III period. These consist of government
financing, a combination of government and partner
contributions, and fully external financing.
The final table, “Sector budgets by MDA”, shows sectors
aligned with relevant MDAs and their expected financing
needs during the NDP III period.

NDP III IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS
Chapter 19
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 142
19.1 Introduction
The National Development Plan is first and foremost an
instrument of the Government of Somaliland, guiding the
national development process in 5-year intervals towards
the achievement of the national goals set out in Vision
2030.
The NDP III contains the costed priority interventions of all
government sectors and MDAs, thus contributing to the
alignment and harmonisation of national goals and sector
strategies while promoting and facilitating the alignment of
NDP III with the national budget.
The total cost estimate of the NDP III clearly surpasses the
financial resources available to the Government of Somaliland,
and as such encompasses priorities and interventions
which, by their nature and based on arrangements in the
past, are expected to be financed by private sector entities
and non-governmental organisations, as well as bilateral
and multi-lateral development partners.
Whereas the government will continuously pursue the
improvement of the alignment of the plan and budget at
the national level, Somaliland’s development partners are
also expected to play a systematic constructive role in
promoting and facilitating the proper alignment of non-government
funding with the NDP III’s priorities.
19.2 Alignment and Coordination
Alignment of the NDP III and the National
Budget
Progress made in the reform of public finance management
during the previous planning period facilitates is due, in
part, to the alignment of the NDP III and the budget. Building
on previous reforms, and in pursuit of this objective,
the NDP III formulation process incorporated the following
elements:
• MDAs were asked to submit the cost estimates of
their priority interventions using digital forms that are
used for the annual budgeting exercise and were
provided by the MoFD.
• Cost estimates were not only aggregated at outcome
level and sector level, but also at MDA level.
• Historical national budget data, provided by the
MoFD, allowed for the identification of expenditures
that are likely to be carried by the national budget.
Although additional steps need to be taken, both MoFD
and MoPND are committed to pursuing the alignment of
NDP III with the budget.
Alignment of Development Assistance:
Aid Effectiveness Principles
The NDP III is Somaliland’s central policy document for
aid and development, but successful implementation will
require an architectural framework that is strongly supported
by its development partners. The NDP III will seek to
strengthen its relationship with international partners based
on the common principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid
Effectiveness and reinforced through further alignment to
the Busan New Deal TRUST principles.
Therefore, the NDP III envisions a partnership with international
and national development partners that is guided by
the aid effectiveness principles of:
1. Ownership: Somaliland must lead its own development
policies and strategies and manage its own
development work on the ground. Somaliland’s ownership
of its agenda is essential if aid is to contribute
towards true sustainable development. Through the
direction of the NDP III, international partners must
support Somaliland in strengthening its capacity
to exercise this kind of leadership by utilising and
reinforcing local expertise, institutions, and management
systems. Multi-Partner Trust Funds, such as
the Somaliland Development Fund, must be further
promoted and utilised by international partners, not
only as vehicles for aid delivery, but also as a tool for
strengthening these systems.
2. Alignment: It is critical the international community
and civil society deliver and align their aid and programmes
firmly behind the priority interventions and
targets of the NDP III. Wherever possible, they must
use local institutions and procedures for managing
aid to build sustainable government structures.
Building on agreements made in the Paris Declaration
on Aid Effectiveness, international partners
will be strongly encouraged to utilise Somaliland’s
procedures for PFM, accounting, auditing, procurement,
and monitoring. Where these systems are in
the process of being institutionalized or not yet firmly
established to sufficiently manage aid effectively,
Somaliland expects further assistance to strengthen
them. To assist the implementation of the NDP III
and to address potential gaps in its delivery, greater
predictability of aid and improved aid flow reporting
to Somaliland will be required. This will require the
international community to further untie its aid to
Somaliland from Somalia.
3. Harmonisation: The NDP III and its supporting architecture
will seek to encourage international partners’
to further improve their coordination of development
work in Somaliland to specifically avoid duplication
and reduce transaction and administrative costs. The
NDP III will seek to reinforce international partner’s
participation in Somaliland’s coordination architecture
at the country and sector levels. This will ease
the strain on the Government of Somaliland in relation
to energy spent on coordinating international
partners, reducing the large numbers of duplicative
field missions, and ensuring that international coordination
efforts are harmonised. Harmonisation with
the NDP III priority interventions and targets will, for
example, extend to pooled funding support mechanisms
to sector and cross-sector strategies such
as multi-partner trusts, national education plans,
national energy strategies, drought prevention, and
multi-sector flagship programmes, in an effort to prevent
fragmentation into multiple individual projects
with separate administrative costs.
4. Managing for results: The NDP III will place more
focus on the resulting impact of development
assistance and the tangible difference it makes in
affecting the lives of Somalilanders. The NDP III,
as the NDP II, will be outcome-focused and linked
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 143
directly to a results-based management framework,
which will allow all stakeholders in Somaliland’s development
to measure and track the impact of aid
and public investment. The NDP III will seek to drive
more direct investment in the development of better
government-led monitoring, evaluation, and statistical
systems and tools in support of the strategy.
5. Mutual accountability: Somaliland and its international
partners will account more transparently to
each other in the use of development assistance
funds, and to their citizens and parliaments for their
impact. NDP III reporting procedures and tools will
be enhanced to report back openly on Somaliland’s
development results. Somaliland’s development
assistance finance will be used as a mechanism to
openly discuss NDP III results, hold stakeholders to
account, highlight successes, and to seek solutions
to challenges. Somaliland will also seek to have
a direct mutual accountability framework with the
international community to ensure that aid delivery
is effective and transparent. To improve data collection
and dissemination regarding results, outcome
targets be collected by MoPND’s Central Statistical
Department and published annually in a special NDP
III section of the publication “Somaliland in Figures”.
MoPND’s M&E department will focus entirely on the
process to achieve the outcome targets, based on
operational benchmarks that have been formulated
for each outcome by the involved government
institutions. This will culminate in an Annual NDP III
Progress Report that will be widely disseminated
online and in print.
A Brief History of Aid Coordination in
Somaliland
The first recognised policy in Somaliland that emphasised
the importance of effective aid coordination was the 2007
Concept Paper on Aid Management and Coordination.
Since then, several governmental acts and policies have
been adopted to strengthen coordination in Somaliland,
among them the Presidential Decree on the Establishment
of a National Aid Coordination Forum, which evolved into
the Somaliland Inter-Ministerial Aid Coordination Committee
(IMACC). The IMACC’s sole responsibility was to
address policy and strategic issues related to aid delivery
in Somaliland. While a very important step for Somaliland’s
aid coordination, the architecture and level of stakeholder
participation was limited only to ministers.
Following this decree and the establishment of the IMACC
a more comprehensive aid coordination policy was developed
in 2010, with the (then) MoPND being responsible
for its implementation. In 2011, a specific Department of
Coordination (DoC) was established within the MoPND.
The DoC established the first initial frameworks of a coordination
architecture in Somaliland, forming sector coordination
forums initially focused on education, health, water,
the economy, ICT, and production. In direct support of the
Somaliland National Vision 2030 and National Development
Plan, these coordination sector forums have further
evolved into the foundation of Somaliland’s current coordination
architecture, coordinating various stakeholders to
achieve Somaliland’s national goals and priorities.
Other important parts of the Somaliland’s coordination
architecture include:
• The High-Level Aid Coordination Forum (HLACF),
which became a platform where all key stakeholders
from the government, international community, and
civil society were able to review progress being
made regarding Somaliland’s development and key
reforms. However, with the demise of the Somaliland
Special Arrangement, the HLACF faltered in holding
its regular meetings.
• The National Planning Commission (NPC), which
formed out of the National Aid Coordination Committee,
whose functionality increased with the
alignment of the multi-partner financed Somaliland
Development Fund (SDF). The SDF utilised the NPC
as the key government decision making body for the
prioritisation and selection of large-scale development
projects.
A performance review was conducted in 2015, focusing
on the functionality of existing sectors. It found that while
some sectors were performing well, there were serious inconsistencies
in the functionality of others. The importance
of individual sector coordination meetings was re-emphasised,
and it was recommended to modify the coordination
architecture to include humanitarian clusters. It resulted in
humanitarian clusters being officially merged into sectors
and a new Somaliland Aid Coordination Policy was released
by the MoPND at the beginning of 2016. The operations of
Somaliland’s coordination architecture should be subjected
to another performance review to revitalize this work for
the NDP III period.
Somaliland’s Current Aid Coordination
Architecture
Somaliland’s current coordination architecture, largely
inherited from the NDP II period, is in principle a platform
for the GoSL, allowing international partners, national organisations,
civil society, and the private sector to align development
and humanitarian activities across Somaliland at
various institutional levels.
As stated in the NDP II document “The Somaliland NDP II
architecture will utilize and build upon the different bodies
and their functions within the existing Somaliland coordination
architecture. The architecture presented will aim to
be a transparent institutional mechanism that will enable
programmes to be prioritised and aligned directly to NDP
II outcomes and targets; ensure that aid is being delivered
effectively and efficiently and provide for strong opportunities
in cross-institutional and sectoral cooperation.”
The Somaliland Aid Architecture and Coordination Model is
made up of four distinct coordination layers (see Figure 20).
Each layer provides an opportunity for all development and
humanitarian stakeholders in Somaliland to engage directly
in the alignment and harmonisation of development and
humanitarian programming. It will provide an opportunity
for the government, civil society, the private sector, diaspora,
and international partners to coordinate, prioritise programming,
critically assess progress, address challenges,
and share information. Terms of reference were developed
for each of the forums defining their membership, roles and
responsibilities, and operations.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 144
Although the coordination architecture will play an important
oversight role for the NDP III, it is also recognised that
this system needs to be reviewed and revitalised. MoPND
is expected to play a leading role in this revitalisation process,
with active support of all development partners who
are members of the recently established High-Level Development
Coordination Forum, the successor of the previous
High-Level Aid Coordination Forum.
Alignment of NDP III and District
Development Frameworks
As observed in the NDP II document, the “district planning
process was led by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) in collaboration
with UN agencies (through the JPLG project) and the
decentralisation champion office under the Vice President.
MoPND had no role in the district planning process. This
means, the national development plan and the regional development
plans on the one hand, and the district planning
process on the other hand, were disconnected.”
This situation hardly changed during the NDP II implementation
period (2017-2021), other than the fact that, for a variety
of reasons (see findings from the regional development
plans review, NDP II, p.285), the regional development
process ended up being eliminated from the cascading
planning process in Somaliland by MoPND. Referring to the
aforementioned review findings, a paradigm change in formulating
regional development plans was devised during
the NDP II period. Instead of putting standalone regional
development plans in place, the major focus was to develop
district development plans in line with the National Decentralisation
Policy in the NDP II era. Consolidated district
development plans will then form the regional development
plans. This change arguably makes alignment of the NDP
with the district planning process less of a challenge, as it
reduces the number of tiers to be aligned from three to two.
Considering the above changes and continuing to pursue
the same goal, additional commitments are needed in the
NDP III period to further pursue alignment and harmonisation
between national and district planning, finding a balance
between national, sectoral, and local priorities whilst
solidifying on-going decentralisation efforts. It is important
to find an “elegant” solution, avoiding costly additions to
an overall process that already takes up a considerable
number of human resources, time, and money. In this context,
both the MoI and the MoPND have included priority
interventions to face this challenge.
19.3 NDP III Implementation
Modalities
Sectoral vs. Intersectoral
As stated at the beginning of this chapter, the National
Development Plan is first and foremost an instrument of
the Government of Somaliland, guiding the national development
process in five-year intervals towards the achievement
of national goals as set out in Vision 2030.
The NDP III is built around sectoral strategies, and as such
follows a sectoral approach in its design and presentation
rather than an integrated multi-sectoral approach. The
GoSL acknowledges that this may lead to less synergies
and multiplier effects, which could result in reduced impact
and less efficient ways of applying the scarce resources
available for the national development process.
On the other hand, implementation roles and responsibilities
can more easily be aligned with existing institutional
mandates when following a sector approach. A more complex
integrated inter-sectoral implementation approach can
lead to unnecessarily high transaction costs, like additional
and more complex coordination structures that need to be
created, and less straightforward decision making processes.
Although the NDP III follows a sectoral approach in its design
and presentation, there is no reason why in certain
instances it cannot be implemented using an integrated
multi-sectoral approach if this is warranted when the
advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. In such
instances, the NDP III priority interventions can be seen as
building blocks from various sectors that can be brought together
in a single project or programme, whilst addressing
gaps, overlaps, and duplication efforts with the institutions
involved.
Projects and (Flagship) Programmes
The NDP III will be implemented using various modalities.
Certain parts will be implemented by the machinery of
Figure 20: Current coordination model in Somaliland
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 145
government administration, like drafting additional policy
and legal instruments, while others, with or without external
financial support, are already thoroughly embedded in a
sector’s institutional routines, like the delivery of education,
health, and water services to the Somaliland population.
However, as is common in national development plans,
other interventions are best rolled out by formulating
several specific projects and programmes. Although they
have a number of similarities, projects and programmes are
defined as follows in the context of the NDP III:
• A project is defined as “a temporary organisation”
that is created for the purpose of delivering one
or more tangible results according to a specified
project description. Projects have an end and are
not designed to last very long. The project manager
ensures that the project delivers the intended goal
within a defined timeframe and budget.
• A programme is defined as “a group of related projects
managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits
and control not available from managing them
individually”. Programmes are usually longer-term
and do not have a fixed deadline. A programme is a
framework of related projects sometimes organised
in components. When programmes are intersectoral
their separate projects can still be aligned with a
single sector to facilitate lines of command and implementation
arrangements.
• A flagship programme, in this context, is a major
programme of the Somaliland government that represents
the main thrust of its developmental policy.
They can be sectoral or intersectoral. Although they
do not intend to be a simple summation of NDP III
priority interventions, their programme description
should at least be explicit about their degree of
alignment, in terms of i) objectives, outcomes, and
interventions, ii) financing, and iii) oversight, management,
outcome targets, and reporting arrangements
to avoid duplication of efforts.
However, it is expected projects, programmes, and flagship
programmes will be coherent entities, and that gaps,
overlaps, and additional opportunities to improve synergies,
efficiency, and impact will be addressed and clearly
described during their formulation phase.
This document does not include a list of projects and
programmes to be designed for the implementation of the
NDP III. The definition of new projects and programmes is
a process that is expected to intensify after the launch of
the NDP III and will in most cases be a joint effort of the
Somaliland Government, represented by MDAs with the
relevant institutional mandates, and national and international
development partners.
Of course, before the NDP III was formulated, several
projects were already in different stages of the design
process and will be part of NDP III implementation, as they
will equally have been aligned with GoSL’s overall or sector-
specific objectives.
This section, however, does suggest next steps for the
process of formulating a limited number of flagship programmes
based, among other things, on the selection of
complementary NDP III priority interventions, exploiting the
comparative strengths that a group of sectors, development
partners, and other relevant stakeholders can bring
to the table to confront the following four core challenges:
1. Boosting Somaliland’s economic and private sector
development, exploring and maximizing opportunities
and multiplier effects created by investments
in the so-called “Berbera Corridor”, and focusing on
second tier and third tier private sector initiatives
along the corridor. The “Berbera Corridor” is generally
understood to stretch from Berbera, through Hargeisa,
to Wajaale on the Ethiopian border. However,
economic and infrastructural investments in Berbera
like the harbour, the Special Economic Zone (expected
to open in the beginning of 2023), and others will
also create opportunities for the eastern hinterland,
stretching from Erigavo, through Las Anood and
Burao, to Berbera. For example, from an economic
potential point of view, this eastern corridor is very
relevant for livestock exports, an important foreign
exchange earner for Somaliland.
2. Improving resilience and livelihoods of agro-pastoral
and pastoral communities in environments
most vulnerable to climatic changes, focusing on
climate-smart practices and value chains for specific
products that will support rural communities in adapting
to climate change. Sustainable community-based
natural resource management will be an important
pillar of this approach. Such a flagship programme
would, for example, include community-based
rangeland management, livestock holding grounds,
quarantine facilities, and strategic water points for
livestock and people along the above-mentioned
eastern corridor, covering Sanaag, Sool, and Toghdeer.
A more coordinated approach between developmental
and humanitarian interventions, striving
for a more integrated approach and leading to more
synergy and joint impact, would be another important
aspect to build into this flagship programme.
3. Climate-smart infrastructural development, which improves
access to affordable services that are crucial
for the development of value chains and private sector
initiatives like energy, water, roads, ICT, markets,
etc., in partnership with local governments and the
private sector. A more integrated planning of central
and local government investments should provide
more synergy and result in boosting the economic
impact of investments in infrastructure at the national
and sub-national levels.
4. Broadening and accelerating support to the decentralisation
process that was started with support from
the JPLG. In each phase, the Ministry of Interior has
gradually increased the number of electoral districts
being supported. Results have been positive and
putting in place a nation-wide programme covering
all 23 electoral districts would be the next logical step
to consolidate progress made in the decentralisation
process in Somaliland.
The suggested next steps are as follows, all to be implemented
during 2023:
• Step 1: Discuss and agree on a next steps document,
based on a dialogue between the GoSL and its key
development partners. It is suggested that a special
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 146
session of the High-Level Development Coordination
Forum could kick off this process.
• Step 2: Joint development and approval of a more
detailed roadmap for the establishment of NDP III
flagship projects. This would be accompanied by a
process to engage key development partners with
a track record of supporting the GoSL in its development
aspirations and discussing financial implications
and mutual commitments to the joint implementation
of the roadmap.
• Step 3: Organisation of a three-to-five-day work retreat
with representatives of joint stakeholders, with
the following expected results:
• A broad outline description of three complementary
intersectoral flagship programmes
that between them ensure coverage of all six
Somaliland regions, considering, on the one
hand, their specific challenges and comparative
advantages, and on the other hand, potential
available financing arrangements.
• The TORs for three detailed pre-feasibility
studies for the indicated flagship programmes,
including logistical and financial commitments
for these studies. These studies will, among
other things, include:
• A clear picture of how and to what extent
they will align with the NDP III and on-going
developments,
• A balanced budget, matching cost estimates
with potential financing arrangements.
• Step 4: Based on the accepted recommendations
of the pre-feasibility studies, initiate the programme
formulation phase.
• Step 5: Appraisal phase of each of the formulated
flagship programmes. It is during this phase that final
financial commitments will be put in place by the
GoSL and all involved development partners and
financing organisations.
The last step should ideally finish before the end of 2023,
but at the latest by the beginning of Somaliland’s national
budgeting cycle in May 2024, so that financial commitments
can be considered when preparing the national budget for
2025.
Immediately after the launch of the NDP III, the Somaliland
Government will present these next steps in a joint session
with key development partners who have a track record of
supporting the GoSL in its development.
19.4 Establishment of the National
Development Fund
As part of the NDP III implementation strategy the government
has initiated a National Development Fund (NDF),
based on transparent and accountable governance principles,
to facilitate the joint financing of priority interventions.
The GoSL will engage with development partners to build
the NDFA into a central financing mechanism for Somaliland's
long-term development. The GoSL will channel
national development resources into the NDF, expecting
development partners to follow suit for NDP III joint implementation.
Development financing frequently relies on intermediary institutions
to administer funds and implement programs and
projects, mainly outside government structures. Evidence
suggests that such arrangements cannot fully support
sustainable institutional capacity development, ownership,
and mutual accountability between government and development
partners. The GoSL is committed to increasing
accountability and transparency to ensure the gradual and
performance-based transferring of external development
resources into the NDF, which will benefit Somaliland's
public financial systems.
19.5 Monitoring, Evaluation,
Accountability, and Learning
This section about monitoring and evaluation touches briefly
on M&E in the context of the NDP III. It is complemented
by the “NDP III MEAL supplement”, which is a detailed technical
manual, produced as a separate booklet, that targets
all M&E staff of Somaliland’s governmental institutions and
development partners and projects that align their interventions
with the NDP III.
The NDP III MEAL supplement is part and parcel of the
National Development Plan III of Somaliland and, as such,
has been approved by the highest authorities. It sets technical
guidelines, norms, and procedures for monitoring,
evaluation, accountability, and learning, all processes that
support evidence-based decision making related to the implementation
of the NDP III and thereby contributing to the
national development goals set by the Somaliland people
in Vision 2030.
Reduction of Outcome Indicators
The NDP II Results Based Management (RBM) framework
defined 223 outcomes and 324 outcome indicators for
nine sectors, or an average of ±25 indicators per sector.
For most of these indicators, data were not collected for a
variety of reasons. The institutional capacity to monitor the
NDP II did not exist, and most government institutions were
overwhelmed by the data demands put on them.
It is a lesson learned from the NDP II to be more selective
in the choice of outcomes and outcome indicators for the
NDP III. In addition, indicators must be measurable in the
context of data collection by Somaliland’s governmental
institutions. The NDP III, although it comes with two additional
sectors, has reduced the total number of outcomes
from 223 to less than 70.
Inclusion of Operational Benchmarks per
Outcome
NDP II outcomes had five-year targets, and these targets
often were not clearly linked to underlying processes that
could be monitored along the way. Although the NDP II’s
Results Framework included the priority interventions
that were needed to achieve the outcome targets, these
turned out to be difficult to monitor. Also, it was not clearly
specified which outputs, and how many of them, would be
critical to achieve the outcome targets.
If, for example, the outcome target was to raise the proportion
of eligible children that attend primary school from 32
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 147
percent to 54 percent, it is important that the plan is also
clear about the outputs that are needed in terms of, for example,
the number of extra classrooms to be built and the
number of additional teachers to be trained. This should
then be costed to ensure coherence between, on the one
hand, the outcome and output targets, and, on the other
hand, the resources needed to achieve them.
Therefore, for each outcome, “critical outputs”, each with
“operational benchmarks”, were formulated in special
meetings with the relevant MDA to better structure the
measurement of progress towards NDP III five-year outcome
targets.
Main Actors for NDP III Monitoring
MoPND’s Central Statistics Department has experienced
staff in data collection and data handling and has for many
years produced and published Somaliland’s annual statistical
bulletin, “Somaliland in Figures”.
In this context, the following changes have been introduced
for the monitoring of the NDP III:
• MoPND’s Central Statistics Department – as opposed
to the ministry’s M&E Department – be exclusively
responsible for coordinating data collection for all
outcome indicators. It will also publish the outcome
indicator values annually in “Somaliland in Figures”,
in a special NDP III section. This publication normally
comes out in October following the data reference
year.
• Government institutions are responsible for monitoring
the operational benchmarks set for all critical
outputs under their implementation and reporting
responsibilities. This should be done in three-to-sixmonth
intervals, under supervision of the director
general, with the participation of all department directors
whose units have oversight for reaching the
benchmarks. In this context, the NDP III RBM matrix
for each outcome is seen as an internal monitoring
tool to support and structure internal management
meetings in each MDA.
• Lastly, MoPND’s M&E department is responsible for
producing and disseminating the NDP III Annual
Progress Report, which compiles the achievement
of operational benchmarks as reported on by MDAs,
including an Executive Summary section with overall
conclusions and recommendations.
It is important the Annual Progress Report is published at
the latest in May/June following the data reference year,
so that possible adjustments can feed into the national
budgeting exercise for the following year, as “Somaliland in
Figures” only comes out in October with outcome-related
data.
MEAL Concepts
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E), has over the past years
evolved into the MEAL approach, adding the concepts of
Accountability and Learning to M&E (MEAL). This change
stems from the realization that the mere collection of data
does not automatically translate to learning and implementation.
The NDP III MEAL supplement will therefore
pay specific attention to describing how data should be
used to systematically contribute to enhanced institutional
accountability and learning and feed into evidence-based
decision making.
Monitoring
Monitoring is the routine collection of data during implementation,
analysing progress largely from a quantitative
point of view. Based on this, managers can verify if the
plan’s objectives and targets are on-track.
Evaluation
While monitoring examines progress against the objective,
evaluation is focused on understanding the causal relationship
between interventions and results. This is especially
important to understand when the intended results are not
forthcoming and scare resources may be wasted (money,
people, materials, time, etc.).
Whereas monitoring is the constant collection of data and
reporting while the plan is being implemented, evaluation is
done occasionally, after a certain period of implementation
when it is reasonable to expect results. For a five-year plan
such as the NDP III, it is normal to have a midterm review
halfway through the plan period and an end of term evaluation.
Evaluations are preferably done by external teams to
ensure an independent and unbiased opinion.
Accountability
In public service there is a clear command chain, defining
from the bottom to the top who is accountable to whom and
in relation to what, determined by institutional mandates
and the terms of reference of civil service functions. This
accountability goes hand in hand with reporting routines in
verbal or written form.
The nature of the reporting normally changes moving up
the command hierarchy, including less operational detail
and instead focusing more on results and the underlying
reasons why these results are or are not forthcoming.
Monitoring and evaluation data needs to feed into management
decisions. For the sake of accountability, it is
best to present conclusions and recommendations based
on summarized data and discuss major findings in senior
management meetings that are routinely scheduled in a
government institution, chaired by the director general or
the minister.
At regular intervals a session could be dedicated to the
presentation and discussion of progress towards reaching
NDP III’s operational benchmarks. It is the task of the director
general, in coordination with the MDA’s Planning and
Statistical Department (PSD) director and the minister, to
set the agenda for such NDP III-dedicated sessions at least
every three to six months.
Learning
Learning is in principle a continuous process and can take
place in any circumstance. However, it cannot be taken for
granted that it will automatically take place, especially at
an institutional level. Institutional learning is often a slow
process, and there can be many reasons for an institutional
environment to not be conducive to learning.
It is therefore important to structure the learning process
and consciously build in learning moments during NDP III
implementation. The NDP III Midterm Review and End of
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 148
Term Evaluation are examples of this at the highest level,
but these learning moments can be organised at lower
levels (MDA, regional, district, etc.) and happen more frequently.
An opportune time for learning exercises would be
in May-June, before the national budgeting starts but after
the MDA’s Annual Progress Report has been made, so that
conclusions and recommendations can feed into the next
national budgeting cycle.
It is important to organise meetings in an environment that is
conducive to learning. Often preference is given to a venue
outside of the regular working environment, although there
may be additional costs attached to this. Also, whereas
accountability sessions mostly take place in management
meetings at various levels along the command chain,
learning is best achieved in a broader (and longer) event,
inviting a wide scope of actors and stakeholders. A doctor,
a nurse, a community leader, a district health official, and
ministry staff will all look at the same situation from different
perspectives. It is the open dialogue about challenging
viewpoints that brings about learning. There is a short-term
cost attached to the learning process, but in the medium- to
long-term, if well-executed, it may lead to substantial savings
by improving the effectiveness of interventions.
Supply and Demand in the MEAL Data
Chain
In the real economy, supply and demand meet each other
in the marketplace, where the value of the goods and
services on offer is determined, influencing both price and
quality.
In a similar fashion, one can say that the supply and demand
side of data meet each other in management meetings,
supported by reports. Good management reports contain
not only reliable data presented in an easy-to-understand
way, but also conclusions and recommendations, which can
shape the dialogue and in turn can lead to sound decision
making and constructive adjustments.
As long there is a systemic and clear demand from leadership
for quality data and reports, the quality of the data
supply chain will undoubtedly improve over time. The
NDP III MEAL supplement devotes a whole chapter to this
demand-and-supply metaphor in the context of MEAL and
how both sides need to be further developed if meaningful
evidence-based decision making is to take place.
The distribution of the separately bound NDP III MEAL supplement
will target the following staff in particular:
• All ministers, directors general, and department directors
of Somaliland’s MDAs.
• Heads and key staff of the Planning and Statistical
Departments and/or M&E units in all MDAs.
• Management staff in all development partner organisations,
programmes, and projects that play a role in
the implementation of the NDP III.
19.6 NDP III Communication
Strategy
The NDP II performance review concluded that the NDP II’s
communication strategy had not been effective in disseminating
its core strategies and interventions and that this
should be a lesson learned for the NDP III.
Until such time that the NDP III communication strategy has
been developed and approved, reference is being made to
section 6.7 (Communication) of the NDP II implementation
chapter (pages 314-316).

MEAL Supplement
2023-2027
Ministry of Planning and National Development
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 152
1. A QUICK INTRODUCTION TO NDP III PLANNING
This Monitoring, Evaluation, Accountability, and Learning
(MEAL) supplement to Somaliland’s National Development
Plan III (NDP III) is designed as a stand-alone document.
It targets all staff that are working in government institutions,
programmes, and projects that are involved in NDP
III knowledge management. This includes data collection,
reporting, accountability processes, evidence-based
decision making, and incorporating lessons learned. This
document is a technical manual which contains detailed
guidelines regarding MEAL in the context of the NDP III.
The NDP III MEAL supplement is particularly relevant for:
• All ministers, directors general, and department directors
of Somaliland’s ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs)
• Leadership and key staff of Planning and Statistical
Departments and/or Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) units in all MDAs
• Management staff in all development partner organisations,
programmes, and projects that play a role in
the implementation of the NDP III
1.1 The Planning Cycle
The planning process consists of anticipating and analysing
the activities required to achieve a desired goal or target.
It is a recurring process where lessons learned during
the implementation plan are clearly identified, leading to
recommendations and agreement on new measures to
include in future strategies. The learning process must be
based on reliable data, which requires monitoring and evaluation.
Monitoring is the routine collection of data during
implementation, reporting on how much has been done
and where, who is being reached, if targets are being met,
etc. Monitoring is usually quantitative in nature. For example,
a monitoring report would inform the reader about how
many new primary schools were built and in which districts,
and how many more boys and girls have access to education
because of the new school. Based on these figures,
managers can verify if sufficient progress has been made
against sector objectives and indicator targets.
However, monitoring does not always show why outcomes
are different than expected targets – that is where evaluation
comes in. Evaluation focuses on understanding the
causal relationship between interventions and the results
of those interventions.
This is particularly important when analysing why intended
results are not forthcoming, especially in an effort to minimize
the waste of resources (time, money, people, etc.).
Whereas monitoring is the constant collection of data and
reporting while the plan is being implemented, evaluation
is done only after a certain period of implementation when
it is reasonable to expect results.
For a five year plan such as the NDP III, it is normal to have
a mid-term review and an end-of-term evaluation. Evaluations
are preferably done by external teams to ensure an
independent and unbiased opinion.
1.2 The Results Framework
Since the 1970s, there has been a continuous evolution
of planning approaches to improve the way international
development projects are measured and evaluated. The
following planning approaches represent major developments
in the last 50 years:
• The Logical Framework Analysis approach (LFA)
• The Results-based Management approach (RBM)
• The Theory of Change approach (TOC)
All three planning approaches seek to develop a thorough
understanding of underlying problems and bottlenecks to
achieve overall medium- to long-term development objectives
(sometimes called project goals, such as poverty reduction
or increased food security). A dialogue is required
between representatives of all involved project stakeholders
so that they can come to a common understanding of
the situation based on a balanced analysis.
Based on this common understanding, stakeholders discuss
the project goal(s), what kind of changes are needed
or desired, and how the project can intervene (activities)
to deliver all the products, goods, services, knowledge,
skills, and attitudes (outputs) that are necessary to reach
the desired changes in reality (outcomes), which in turn are
needed to achieve the overall project goal(s) (impact).
Taken together, a logical framework (usually called a “logframe”)
or “results framework” is created to summarize
the logical steps needed for achieving the project goal.
Different organisations may choose to use slightly different
terms and formats for their results frameworks. It is often a
table with four-to-five rows and four columns, which is often
called a matrix.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 153
1.3 Instructions for Completing a
Logframe Matrix
• Column A: From bottom to top, enter i) concise descriptions
of the project’s activities, ii) the expected
outputs once these activities have been implemented,
iii) the expected desired outcomes needed to
reach the project foal, and iv) the overall project goal.
• Column B: From top to bottom, enter the impact,
outcome, and output indicators, and their respective
targets. These determine how progress is measured
(indicators) and the project’s ambitions (targets).
• Column C: State the source of the data for each
indicator, such as which institutions are responsible
for providing the data for the indicator’s value. Preferably,
data collection should be done by an independent
institution, but this is sometimes difficult due
to excessive costs.
• Column D: Enter the assumption of risks, which are
external factors that cannot be directly controlled
by project managers and could have an influence,
whether positive or negative, on the activities,
outputs, outcomes, and project goal described in
column A.
Since its introduction in the 1970s, the logframe matrix has
been widely used for projects. However, it is important to
note that projects have a more specific focus in terms of
their goals and involved stakeholders than the overall National
Development Plan, which covers all of Somaliland’s
government institutions and development challenges from
a high-level perspective.
Because of its wider scope, it is not practical to elaborate a
complete logframe matrix for the NDP III. However, the NDP
III planning framework is founded on the above-mentioned
planning approaches and adopts and adapts some of their
structural elements.

2. FROM NDP II TO NDP III
2.1 A Reduction of Outcome
Indicators
The NDP II’s Results-based Management (RBM) framework
defined 223 outcomes and 324 outcome indicators, or an
average of ±22 outcomes per sector. For most of these
indicators, data was not collected for a variety of reasons.
Most indicators were either not measurable or the institutional
capacity to collect the necessary data did not exist. It
is a key lesson learned from the NDP II to be more selective
of the choice of indicators for the NDP III and try to align
them as much as possible with existing routine data collection
mechanisms. The NDP III has a total of 60 outcomes, or
an average of six outcomes per sector.
2.2 A Stronger Focus on Evidencebased
Decision Making
An important principle of the RBM approach is to focus on
data that is necessary for evidence-based decision making.
The RBM approach also emphasises that different types of
managers require different types of data. In this context, the
NDP III MEAL approach distinguishes between operational
managers and strategic managers.
Operational managers are responsible for the implementation
of interventions on the ground and are focused on immediate
output targets resulting from these interventions.
On the other hand, strategic managers are more focused
on outcome targets – rather than outputs – and analyse
and discuss changes in approach to better meet targets.
Strategic managers should only shift their focus to outputs
if outcome targets are not showing sufficient progress and
they suspect this may be caused by certain output targets
not being achieved.
2.3 The NDP II Results Framework
The NDP II has the following structural elements in its results
framework:
• Alignment with the UN Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs)
• Outcomes, outcome indicators, and priority interventions
• Outcome baseline values (2016) and target values
(2021)
Although the NDP II’s results framework includes priority
interventions that are needed to achieve outcome targets,
these were found too difficult to monitor, partly because
it was not clearly specified how these interventions were
supposed to contribute to outcome targets.
To address this issue, for each outcome the NDP III identifies
the two or three most important outputs, including
their annual operational benchmarks. These “critical
outputs” must directly address bottlenecks that otherwise
would block significant progress in achieving the outcome
targets. The following section shows an example from
the education sector of how to define critical outputs for
a given outcome target, as well as associated operational
benchmarks for each year.

2.4 Example Guidelines for
Setting Critical Outputs for NDP III
Outcomes
Outcome: By 2027, there will be an increase in access and
participation in primary education.
Outcome indicator: Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)
In the education sector, the Gross Enrolment Rate (GER)
outcome indicator shows that in the 2020-2021 academic
year the number of eligible students (6-13 years of age)
enrolled in primary school was only 32 percent. In other
words, 68 percent of all Somaliland children of primary
school-age who should have been in school are not getting
access to formal education. Every child has the right to
education, so this outcome indicator can easily be justified
as one of strategic value, as it will measure and quantify
an important improvement in education and in the lives of
many children in Somaliland.
As such, the Ministry of Education and Science wants
to raise the GER from 32 percent (2021) to 54 percent
(2027), or an increase of 22 percent over the NDP III
period. The following five steps can guide the sector to
determine suitable output indicators and targets for this
outcome:
1. Identify the main problems that cause children to not
attend primary school, as well as their underlying
causes.
There may be various reasons why primary school attendance
is so low. Problems could include a lack of schools
or qualified teachers, cost barriers, or that parents and their
children do not live in a fixed location, among others. Note
that there may be different problems for different locations,
for example between urban and rural areas.
2. For each main problem, make a list of interventions
that are needed to address the issue.
To identify the proper interventions, it is important to examine
i) the complexity of the problem, ii) the cost to provide
a solution, and iii) the extent to which solving the problem
leads to positive results in terms of the desired outcome. A
balance needs to be found to identify the interventions that
give the best “value for money and effort”.
For example, enrolling more children (leading to a higher
GER) can only be achieved if more schools – and extra
classrooms for existing schools – are built, especially in the
662 rural settlements without education facilities. This is
an important lead intervention. However, enrolling more
pupils also requires more teachers and more textbooks.
To employ more teachers a request needs to be made
in advance by the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of
Finance to include more funding for teachers' salaries in
the next year’s budget. All of these are examples of complementary
interventions that follow from the lead intervention
(building classrooms). Adjustments in the target of
the lead intervention immediately leads to adjustments in
the targets of the complementary interventions (fewer new
classrooms mean fewer teachers and textbooks).
However, a lack of infrastructure may only be one of the
main problems. Especially in the rural areas, parents may
need to be convinced of the importance of primary schooling
for their children. They could be convinced through
an information campaign or by setting up a school meals
program, especially in areas where food security is an issue.
Both are examples of other lead interventions that may
need their own complementary interventions.
3. From the list of lead interventions, select the 2-4 that
are the most critical.
Critical interventions are lead interventions that are absolutely
essential to reach the outcome. If these interventions
are poorly implemented there will be a significant negative
impact on reaching the outcome target.
In the context of this example: An important bottleneck for
increasing the enrolment of children in primary school is
the lack of physical infrastructure (classrooms). Classrooms
are, on average, already crowded with a Pupil Class Ratio
(PCR) of 50 students per class, so they likely cannot take in
more students. A critical intervention, therefore, is the construction
of schools and extra classrooms, particularly in
the 662 rural settlements that have no education facilities.
If the construction of extra classrooms does not take place,
achieving the outcome of increased primary school attendance
will be significantly hampered or even practically
impossible. Therefore, the construction of extra classrooms
can be considered a critical lead intervention. This automatically
puts the importance of all its dependant complementary
interventions in the spotlight as well.
4. Formulate all critical lead interventions as critical
outputs with associated operational benchmarks.
The critical intervention of “construction and expansion of
primary schools” needs to be transformed into a critical
output with one or more measurable annual operational
benchmarks that allow operational managers to verify
regular implementation progress. This means that for each
operational benchmark, end-of-year targets need to be set.
• The critical output could be formulated as “newly
constructed, rehabilitated, or extended primary
schools”.
• Operational benchmarks for this critical output could
include:
• The number of newly constructed primary
schools
• The number existing primary schools that have
been extended or rehabilitated.
• The number of additional classrooms that are
available in primary schools.
As there is a policy to measure progress separately in the
urban and rural areas, it is possible to create two sub-indicators,
adding in “rural primary schools” or “urban primary
schools” to the operational benchmark description.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 156
5. Setting ambitious but realistic targets at outcome
and associated critical output level.
After defining a set of critical outputs and their operational
benchmarks, it is important to reflect on the institution’s capacity
to achieve them. If the goal is to raise the GER from
32 percent to 54 percent by 2027 (the outcome target),
this means that an additional 185,000 students need to be
enrolled, or ±37,000 per year.
Question if the outcome target poses a realistic challenge,
solely from the point of view of increasing enrolment.
In addition, following our example, at the critical output
level this also means that:
• An estimated 2,310 classrooms need to be made
available
• Extra teachers need to be recruited to teach an additional
4,620 classes (complementary intervention)
• Extra schoolbooks need to be procured and distributed
(complementary intervention)
There may be other critical outputs which are essential to
making this significant increase in enrolment a realist target,
such as intensifying school meal programmes in rural
areas.
Again, it is important to question if all critical outputs
and associated operational benchmarks are realistic
challenges.
If any of the critical outputs and operational benchmarks
are not achievable, the outcome target needs to be reduced.
Ambitious targets are good, but they also need to
be realistically achievable. Setting impossible targets leads
to frustration and can also result in a waste of resources,
such as empty classrooms or students without textbooks.
This entire process is detailed in Figure 2. Once this exercise
is complete, all elements are brought together in the
NDP III Results Framework (or RBM matrix) shown in Figure
3, which consists of an output and outcome section.

Description of the link between critical outputs, critical output targets and outcome:
OUTPUT EDU - 1.1: An important bottleneck for increasing the enrolment of children in primary school is the lack of physical infrastructure (classrooms). A priority
intervention is therefore the construction of schools, particularly by targeting the 662 rural settlements that have no education facility at all. Classrooms are on average
already crowded with a Pupil Class Ratio (PCR) of 50 students per class so cannot be expected to absorb new students. An increase of the GER from 32% to 54%
would mean an extra 255.000 pupils (22% of the estimated primary school age population in 2027), and therefore a total of 2.550 extra classrooms if keeping the same
PCR and assuming that a classroom is used for 2 groups of students every day.
OUTPUT EDU - 1.2: Out of a total of 936 government owned primary schools 40 % (374 schools) are estimated to be in a high food security risk area and will be
targeted for food-based incentive programs. School selection is based on parameters like i) food security, 2) child nutrition status, 3) drought risk, etc.
OUTPUT EDU - 1.3: Annual "Go-To-School" campaigns will be held with a focus on places where extra schoolrooms are expected to become available before the start
of the academic year, and food-based programs are prioritized. In the rural areas, Educational Cluster Coordinators will be involved in these awareness campaigns. In
the baseline year 2021 there were a total of 154 educational clusters in Somaliland, covering 10 rural settlements each.

3. MONITORING THE NDP III
3.1 Data Supply and Demand
Principles
The mechanism of supply and demand and how it affects
the value of goods and services is well known in the marketplace.
For the MEAL system to work, it is also crucial that
there is a good balance between the supply and demand
sides of data and management information.
If monitoring data is collected but managers show insufficient
interest or do not appreciate its value for decision
making, is a high supply of data but weak demand. Consequently,
the quality of the data supply-chain will suffer. As in
the marketplace, it is important that there is transparency,
predictability, and stability in data demand and supply.
As supply normally follows demand, it is important to first
and foremost stabilize the demand side of management
information. This is done by defining who is demanding
what data, and when and how often it is needed. Once this
is clearly defined and institutional routines are established,
the data collection supply chain will be able to organise
itself and create the capacity needed to satisfy demand.
It is acknowledged that NDP III related data collection and
reporting is only part of the data that managers need to
effectively manage their institution. Therefore, NDP III
monitoring obligations, whenever possible, are kept to a
minimum.
3.2 Technical Aspects of
Monitoring NDP III Progress
How to Assess Critical Outputs and
Operational Benchmarks
There is a distinction between monitoring the NDP III’s
critical outputs and operational benchmarks, which is more
important for operational managers, and monitoring progress
towards the five year sector outcome targets, which is
more important for strategic managers.
It is beyond the purpose of this MEAL supplement to explain
in detail each sector’s data collection chain, from the
field level to central level professional statistics department
(PSD), as this differs greatly from sector to sector. It is therefore
assumed that each MDA will take action to improve
their internal data collection chain in such a way that they
can satisfy the minimum requirements put forward in this
MEAL supplement regarding NDP III monitoring. Therefore,
this MEAL supplement assumes that MDA data collection
chains are sufficiently functional so that relevant data will
be available at the PSD level.
It is strongly recommended that the senior management
of each MDA discusses NDP III progress in relation to the
critical outputs and the associated operational benchmarks
for which they are responsible every three to six months.
This is best done through an operational progress report
prepared by PSD staff, under the guidance of the director
general. There are two different types of operational
benchmarks:
• Most operational benchmarks attempt to indicate
important steps through established milestones.
The RBM matrix uses only three simple categories
that roughly measure progress by indicating if it is
pending (marked with “- -“), in progress, or completed.
This can often easily be answered through
institutional memory and does not require systematic
data collection.
• However, there are also operational benchmarks
with numerical targets, showing for each year how
many outputs need to be achieved, such as how
many schools need to be built.
The following example shows the difference between the
types of operational benchmarks.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 159
Example of the Different Types of
Operational Benchmarks
In the following example, the critical output CCT-DAC – 3.1 is
broken down into three different operational benchmarks.
1. The first operational benchmark (CCT-DAC – 3.1.a)
represents a process of developing and approving
guidelines and criteria for awarding small grants. This is
obviously an important step before starting to process
grant requests. As shown in the table, the benchmarks
indicate that this should start in 2023 and be completed
by 2024.
2. The second operational benchmark (CCT-DAC – 3.1.b)
shows the number of grant applications that are expected
to be submitted by people living in displacement
affected communities (DACs). This reflects the
expected impact of this intervention, which depends
on, among other variables, how thoroughly the National
Displacement and Refugee Agency (NDRA) informed
eligible recipients about the availability of the grants
and how aligned the grants are to people’s needs and
expectations. These are numerical targets for each
year. Note that these are accumulated totals showing
what NDRA expects to achieve until the end of each
year, including all the accumulated achievements of
the previous years.
If targets are not met in previous years, it will increase
the amount of work to reach future targets. For example,
if only 110 instead of 130 grant applications have
been processed in 2024, then it means that the target
for 2025 is not 170 grant applications but 190. Sometimes
it makes more sense to have annual totals. In this
case, targets that are not met in a previous year do not
increase the burden to meet future targets.
3. The third operational benchmark (CCT-DAC – 3.1.c) in
this example is also numerical, but shows percentages,
estimating the proportion of people who requested a
grant that actually received a grant. This is linked to
people’s capability to successfully apply for a grant.
Factors that impact this benchmark include the complexity
of the application process and the criteria for
approving a grant.
This is also an accumulated total, meaning that at the
end of the NDP III a total of 280 (40% x 700) applicants
must have received a grant (not just 40% of the 170
people that are expected to apply in 2027). This puts
extra pressure on the NDRA to continuously improve
their performance by adapting the application process.
For supervisors who are directly responsible for the implementation
of activities that will lead to achieving operational
benchmarks, it is important to understand the progress in
every operational benchmark. However, senior managers
like directors general and ministers may prefer a more general
picture, based on a summarized overview of progress
in achieving a set of operational benchmarks.
The following example shows how to summarize benchmark
achievements that contribute to the same outcome.
When reporting, it is also important to describe unusual situations
that affected performance during implementation
in a short paragraph for each outcome.

Summarizing Performance for
Completing Benchmarks
There are two components to summarizing the
performance of operational benchmarks that fit under
the same outcome, depending on the type of benchmark
target:
1. Summarising the overall performance of a series of operational
benchmarks that were defined by milestones.
2. Presenting the implementation rate of a series of operational
benchmarks that have numerical targets, i.e.,
accumulated or annual totals.
The above table shows how the overall performance of a
series of benchmarks with annual milestones is determined
(example for Outcome ECO – 1 in reporting year 2024, see
annex).
1. The first step is to copy the outcome from the RBM
matrix.
2. The second step is to verify, in the 2024 column of the
outcome’s RBM matrix, the total number of operational
benchmarks that were expected to be either completed,
in progress, or pending (indicated by “- -“). The
totals are then entered in column (a) for each of the
milestone categories (see below).
3. Each milestone category is assigned a scoring percentage:
• Each benchmark that is expected to be completed is
assigned 100%
• Each benchmark that is expected to be in progress
is assigned 25%
• Each benchmark that is expected to be pending (“-
-“) is assigned 0%
After determining the total scores for each benchmark’s
milestone category, they are summed up, as shown in column
(b): 475%.
4. The fourth step is to check the real situation and register
the total number of operational benchmarks that
have actually reached completion, are in progress,
or are pending at the end of 2024. This is entered in
column (c).
5. Again, the same scoring percentages are used for
each of the milestone categories. These are summed
up for each milestone category and entered in column
(d): 725%.
6. The last step is to determine the “Overall Performance
Score”, which is equal to the "total reported score" DIVIDED
BY the "total planned score" TIMES 100%, which
is 725% DIVIDED BY 475% " TIMES 100% = 153%.
As the Overall Performance Score is higher than 100%,
implementation is going faster than expected in the plan.
It is important to note that this is a rough method of estimating
the Overall Performance Score because the size
and complexity of achieving each operational benchmark
can be very different. However, this method gives a general
overview if things are more or less on track.
A different and simpler method used to present the completion
of quantitative (numerical) benchmarks is shown in
the table above (example ECO – 6):
1. The number of units planned for each operational
benchmark are entered in column (a).
2. The number of units that are reported to be accomplished
at the end of the reporting year are entered in
column (b)
3. For each operational benchmark the performance is
calculated separately, as follows: (reported amount)

3.3 How to Assess Sector Outcome
Indicators
In contrast to operational benchmark monitoring, the collection
of data for sector outcome indicators only occurs once
every year. This process runs parallel to the production of
the annual operational progress report by compiling four
quarterly progress reports, as described in the following
section. There are important differences between reporting
on operational benchmarks and reporting on outcome
indicator targets:
• Monitoring of operational benchmarks is a relatively
simple process. In contrast, most outcome indicators
have quantitative (numerical) targets and often rely
on a fairly complex data collection systems, involving
many implementation units (like schools, health
posts, etc.) at various institutional levels. For example,
to measure the primary school GER, MoES needs
to collect enrolment data from all primary schools in
Somaliland.
• Many outcome indicator values are recognized as
important national statistics and therefore need to be
submitted to MoPND’s Central Statistical Department
for quality control, as they, once officially published,
will be important national and international reference
points. This is not the case with operational benchmarks.
Reporting on Progress Towards Outcome
Indicator Targets
This table takes the indicators for Outcome ECO – 1 as an
example of how progress should be reported on outcome
targets at the end of any given year in the NDP III period.
This table has two sections:
• Section A is simply an exact copy of the relevant
outcome information in the RBM matrix. This serves
only as a point of reference to understand the calculations.
• Section B shows the actual calculations to arrive at
the “proportion of the 5-year targeted increase that
has been achieved”. The mathematics behind this
are explained below.
Attention: This is not the proportion of the target value,
but it is the proportion of the increase needed on top of
the baseline value to arrive at the target value (target value
MINUS baseline value). The numbers in both sections of
the table for indicator ECO – 1.A are detailed below:
Table A: Outcome indicator baseline and target values
copied from the RBM matrix
• Column (a) shows the unit of measurement
• Column (b) shows the baseline value in 2021 (775
USD GDP per capita, for indicator ECO – 1.A)
• Column (c) shows the target value in 2027 (1,160 USD
GDP per capita)
• Therefore, the total increase expected during the
NDP III period is the target value MINUS baseline
value, or 1,160 USD MINUS 775 USD = 385 USD per
capita.
Table B: Real progress as recorded at the end of the reporting
year (2024)
• Column (k) shows the reporting year (2024) and the
real value as recorded at the end of the reporting
year, which for this example is a GDP value of 920
USD per capita.
• Column (I) shows the difference between the reporting
year (2024) and the baseline value year (2021),
so 3 years. Note that in this case the total period
between the baseline year (2021) and target value
year (2027) is six years.
• Column (m) shows that it is reasonable to expect that
50% of the target increase will have been reached,
because 50% of the time has passed between the
baseline year and target year (three out of six years).

14.0% 3 2.75% 4.50%
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 162
This would be 385 USD TIMES 50% = 192.50 USD
per capita. This is the expected progress.
• Column (n) shows the real progress made during the
three years that passed since the baseline year, so
920 USD MINUS 775 USD = 145 USD. This the real
progress.
• Finally, column (o) shows the proportion of the targeted
increase that was achieved. This is equal to (real
progress) DIVIDED BY (expected progress) TIMES
100%. So, for this example, 145 USD per capita DIVIDED
by 192.50 USD per capita TIMES 100% = 75.3%.
Conclusion: Although progress has been made, it is less
than expected, as the “% of the targeted increase” is less
than 100%.
Regarding Indicator ECO – 1.B we can now quickly observe
the following:
• The total targeted increase is equal to the target value
in column (c) MINUS the baseline value in column
(b), or 15% MINUS 9.5% = 5.5%.
• The real progress is the real value in column (k) MINUS
the baseline value in column (b), which is 14%
MINUS 9.5% = 4.5%.
• The expected progress is 50% TIMES 5.5% = 2,75%
(column m) as only three out of six years have passed
since the baseline value was recorded.
• Finally, column (o) shows the proportion of the targeted
increase that was achieved. This is equal to (real
progress) DIVIDED BY (expected progress) TIMES
100%. So, for this example, this is 4.5% DIVIDED BY
2,75% TIMES 100% = 163.64%.
Conclusion: Because this is higher than 100%, progress is
faster than anticipated.
Regarding Indicator ECO – 1.C we can observe the following:
• This is an entirely different case. The numbers in
Table A should not be interpreted as if the government
wants to increase annual inflation from 5.6%
(the baseline value in 2021) to 10% (the target value
in 2027). Inflation is not a good thing, and all governments
want to keep it as low as possible.
• The target of the Central Bank of Somaliland is to
keep annual inflation below 10% and preferably much
lower. However, there are many external factors that
influence inflation.
• MoPND’s CSD collects consumer prices and calculates
the inflation figures in Somaliland. This is an
indicator which only has two possible answers, in this
case the answer "yes" or "no" (this is called a Boolean
indicator).
• If inflation is less than 10% the correct answer is “Yes,
inflation is within its target margin of less than 10%.”
This is the case in the baseline year when annual
inflation was at 5.6%. However, if annual inflation is
higher than 10% the correct answer is “No, inflation is
not within its target margin of less than 10%.”
• In the example above, the real value registered for
2024 is 7% annual inflation. This is less than 10%, so it
is within the margin set by the Central Bank, and the
correct answer is therefore “Yes, inflation is within its
target margin of less than 10%.”
So, although the example given for the first two indicators
is useful for the vast majority of NDP III quantitative (numeric)
outcome indicator targets, the example of the third
indicator shows there may be exceptions and common
sense should prevail to identify those exceptional cases.
Outcome Indicators Using Somaliland
Population Data
There are many outcome indicators that require Somaliland
population data of a specific age group in the way they are
expressed, for example:
• The proportion of citizens, 16 years or older, that
have a national ID card.
• The Gross Enrolment Ratio in primary education, or
the proportion of all Somaliland children of primary
school age (6-13 years old), who are enrolled in primary
education.
• The prevalence of stunting in children under 5 years
of age, or the proportion of all Somaliland children
who are zero to four years old who show clear
characteristics of stunting as diagnosed in health
facilities.
It is important that a common reference point is being utilized
and that from year to year the estimated population
growth is calculated correctly for population-based indicators.
A Population Reference Table is included in Annex 5, which
is based on PESS-2014 population figures for ages zero to
75 years old and includes projections for each year of the
NDP III period based on an estimated population growth of
2.93% per year. This Population Reference Table has been
approved by MoPND’s Central Statistical Department.
This also includes a separate table with population-based
NDP III outcome indicators and the projected size of associated
age groups for each year of the NDP III period. This
has been included to provide a common reference point
and avoid miscalculations.
3.4 Annual reporting
Operational Progress Reports
Reporting on operational benchmarks is done
through 3-6 monthly Operational Progress
Reports. The minimum requirements for these reports are:
• An overview of critical outputs and operational
benchmarks under the MDA’s responsibility, as presented
in the relevant NDP III RBM matrices.
• Progress achieved in the previous 3-6 months for
each of the operational benchmarks associated with
critical outputs under the MDA’s responsibility.
• Problems that may affect the achievement of the
benchmark targets and proposed measures to
counter such operational problems.
• General conclusions and a summary of recommended
actions, including the entity that will be responsible
and the completion deadline.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 163
The evidence-based conclusions and recommendations,
formulated by the director general with support from the
PSD, are a critical part of Progress Reports. This will help
in focusing the discussion, facilitating decision making, and
formulating action points during the management meeting.
Depending on the dynamics in top management in each
MDA, the following 7 steps in information management are
suggested, as shown in Figure 4.
1. The head of the PSD, together with their staff, must
ensure that the data supply chain produces a draft
Operational Progress Report in a timely manner, which
is presented to the director general and contains the
elements previously mentioned.
2. The director general, the head of the PSD, and any other
relevant staff will then have a meeting to discuss and
(re-)formulate all conclusions and recommendations
contained in the draft progress report. In the context of
their institutional function, the DG is ultimately responsible
for data verification to ensure that all conclusions
and recommendations are evidence-based.
3. After this meeting with the DG, a concise Progress
Summary Brief is prepared for validation by the minister
or agency director. The Progress Summary Brief
contains the most important data and the final draft of
the conclusions and recommendations of the Progress
Report.
4. At the same time, the PSD and DG prepare a draft Rolling
Action Matrix (RAM), which serves to register recommended
actions to be taken based on the Progress
Report. The term “rolling” means that new recommended
actions will be added continuously at the bottom
of the list and only fully implemented actions can be
taken off the list. The Rolling Action Matrix is a simple
table with seven columns (see Figure 5).
5. The minister or agency director will then be asked to
call a special NDP III management meeting where the
Progress Summary Brief and the Rolling Action Matrix
are discussed, possibly revised, and validated.
6. The validated Progress Summary Brief will be added
to the Progress Report and can now be shared with
external partners.
7. However, the Rolling Action Matrix is considered an
internal management instrument, and future senior
management meetings should start with verifying the
status of the agreed upon actions, ensuring that deadlines
are met and adding any new actions.
Critical outputs and their associated operational benchmarks
are always assigned to specific MDAs (see final column
in the RBM matrices). The responsibility for reporting
on them is therefore also assigned to that MDA.
Each year, the PSD in any given MDA must compile the 3-6
monthly validated Progress Reports into a single institutional
Annual Operational Progress Report. In principle, these
reports do not include sector outcome related data.
The validated Annual Operational Progress Reports are
shared by each MDA with the MoPND’s M&E department,
which should receive in total 50-60 reports. It is expected
that most of these reports will be between 3-5 pages in
length.

Sector Outcome Progress Reports
In contrast to operational benchmarks, which are assigned
to MDAs, outcomes and outcome targets are assigned to
sectors. In sectors with more than one MDA it is not always
clear who is responsible for outcome data collection and
reporting.
Therefore, MoPND assigned a lead MDA for each sector,
which will be responsible for reporting to the Central Statistics
Department (CSD) on outcome indicator values and
supporting data. The CSD has quarterly meetings with relevant
PSDs in the existing Statistical Working Group, where
the harmonisation of this process will be discussed.
The following list shows the lead MDA in their sector for the
purpose of collecting data on NDP III outcome indicators
and submitting them to MoPND’s CSD:
• Economic Sector: MoTT
• Energy and Extractive Sector: MoEM
• Production Sector: MoLFD
• Infrastructure Sector: MoTRD
• Governance Sector: MoI
• Education Sector: MoES
• Health Sector: MoHD
• Social Protection Sector: MESAF
• Judciary Sector: SCS
• Cross-cutting Themes: MESAF
Sector lead MDAs should coordinate sector data collection
using the following process:
• Some sector outcomes clearly align with the institutional
mandate of another MDA in the sector, so the
lead MDA can assign data collection for that outcome
to the relevant MDA and only needs to provide oversight
to ensure that the responsible MDA collects the
relevant data for that outcome.
• In other cases, the lead MDA will have to collect the
data themselves as there is no alternative MDA in the
sector who can be expected to do so.
• All outcome data will be gathered by the lead MDA
and presented in a separate Annual Sector Outcome
Progress Report for the whole sector.
The Annual Sector Outcome Progress Report is submitted
by the sector lead MDA to MoPND’s Central Statistical
Department, who will receive a total of 12 reports (1 per
sector). It is expected that most of these reports will be
no more than 5-10 pages.
The NDPIII National Annual Progress
Report
Every year, the available data from the Annual Operational
Progress Reports, prepared by all MDAs, and the Annual
Sector Outcome Progress Reports, prepared by sector lead
MDAs, will be merged into a single document, the NDP III
National Annual Progress Report.
Every year, MoPND’s M&E Department must integrate the
12 Sector Outcome Progress Reports with the 50-60 Operational
Progress Reports, combining them into a single
NDP III National Annual Progress Report. This is a significant
task for the involved staff and MoPND should consider
mobilizing additional resources for the M&E department for
a 2-3-week period once the majority of Progress Reports
have been made available. The NDP III National Annual
Progress Report is the most important report each year
for promoting accountability and learning at various levels
(Sector Coordination Forums, the National Planning Commission,
the High-level Development Coordination Forum,
etc.). The Annual Progress Report is the cornerstone for
maintaining a fruitful dialogue with development partners
and boosting the NDP III’s Resource Mobilization Strategy.
Figure 6 illustrates the annual reporting process.
The compiled NDP III National Annual Progress Report
includes the following sections:
• An executive summary, including the most important
conclusions and recommendations from the sector
chapters.
• For each sector, the end-of-year real values of sector
outcome indicators and the degree to which NDP III
outcome targets have been reached.
• Under each of the outcomes, an overview of operational
benchmarks that have been completed,
and how many are expected to be completed. This
includes a short analysis of how operational benchmark
completion has been affected, positively or
negatively, against outcome levels.

3.5 Dissemination and Publication
of Progress Reports
The Operational Progress Reports (by
MDAs)
Once the Quarterly and Annual Operational Progress Reports
have been analysed, discussed, possibly adjusted,
and validated, they can shared with external partners either
as a digital copy or hard copy.
The following is recommended for MDA-validated Operational
Progress Reports:
1. All MDAs prepare their 3-6 monthly Operational
Progress Report, as previously explained. The report
is validated by each MDA in a special senior management
meeting.
2. All MDAs share their report with the chair and cochair
of the associated Sector Coordination Forum
(SCF), who will put a discussion of the MDA reports
on the agenda of the next SCF meeting. In principle,
the MDA quarterly reports are always distributed by
email to all SCF members.
3. If important issues are identified in the SCF meetings
that need to be brought to the attention of the relevant
MDA, the SCF chair and co-chair can issue an
official SCF memo to the relevant minister or agency
director.
The National Annual Progress Report (by
MoPND)
The following entities are targeted in the process of validating
and disseminating the NDP III National Annual Progress
Report:
• Sector Coordination Forums
• The Intersectoral Coordination Forum
• The National Planning Commission
• The Cabinet
• The President’s Office
It may also be desirable, once validated by the National
Planning Commission, to share evidence-based information
with engaged development partners as part of the NDP III’s
Resource Mobilization Strategy, so this can be discussed in
the High-level Development Coordination Forum or other
assemblies.
The information management steps suggested for the NDP
III Annual Progress Report involve different authorities, as
depicted in Figure 8 and explained below:
1. All MDAs in each sector submit their Annual Operational
Progress Report to MoPND’s M&E department in a
timely manner, according to predetermined deadlines.
Simultaneously, each sector lead MDA submits its Sector
Outcome Progress Report to MoPND’s CSD.
2. The CSD and the M&E department will conduct a quick
quality-check on the Progress Reports, based on the
following criteria:
• Checking for all relevant data according to the
guidelines
• Checking the report contains credible data
presented in a user-friendly format
• Checking data tables for any errors in calculated
values
• Ensuring that data tables are accompanied by
text that contextualizes the data
• Confirming the report contains a Summary Brief
with clear data-based conclusions and recommendations
3. The CSD will formally validate all outcome indicator
values so that the M&E department can include them in
the NDP III National Annual Progress Report.
4. MoPND’s M&E department will then compile the NDP
III National Annual Progress Report, which is organised
by sector chapters and also contains an overall
executive summary and a section on conclusions and
recommendations.
Figure 7: Dissemination of Operational Progress Reports to the SCFs
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 166
5. The NDPIII National Annual Progress Report is shared
with SCF chairs and co-chairs, who and then share the
report with the Intersectoral Coordination Forum (ISCF).
6. The National Planning Commission, chaired by Mo-
PND, will organise a special session to validate the
NDP III National Annual Progress Report, addressing
comments and observations before official distribution.
7. The CSD will publish the validated outcome indicator
values in a NDP III section (or in a special edition) of the
Somaliland-in-Figures publication later in the year.
3.6 Reporting Calendar
Figure 9 shows the reporting calendar for the three types
of reports and the institutions that are responsible.
• Operational Progress Reports (four quarterly and one
annual)
• Sector Outcome Progress Report (1)
• National Progress Report (1)
3.7 Reporting Language
Progress Reports that are elaborated by the MDAs at
central level should be written in English. This makes it
easier to share these reports with non-Somali speaking
development partners. However, these reports in English
will include an executive summary in Somali.

4. EVALUATION OF THE NDP III
4.1 Midterm Review of the NDP III
There was no Midterm Review of the NDP II, so a key learning
moment was lost. Because evaluation focuses on understanding
the causal relationship between interventions
and results – as opposed to monitoring, which consists
of only routine data collection – it important that MoPND
conducts a Midterm Review of the NDP III. Figure 10 shows
a suggested calendar for the midterm review
Please note the following guidance on the mid-term review:
• MoPND is responsible for leading and coordinating
the preparation and implementation of the different
steps in the calendar.
• It is important that MoPND involves stakeholders in
the preparation and implementation of the Midterm
Review so that they will feel ownership of the major
conclusions and recommendations and be willing to
adjust interventions. A good starting point for this is
the joint approval of the terms of reference based on
a jointly-developed review methodology.
• The focus of the Midterm Review should be on identifying
the most important lessons learned based on
identified major implementation bottlenecks, and to
a lesser extent on progress in sector outcomes, as
there only will have been two years of implementation.
To facilitate this, MoPND must ensure that the
Annual Operational Progress Reports and National
Annual Progress Reports of 2024 and 2025 are
made available to the Midterm Review team.
• Financial resources have been tentatively planned
in the NDP III budget for the Midterm Review (US$
85,000). However, a financial budget proposal should
be made based on the approved methodology and
terms of reference.
• Finally, MoPND must ensure the Midterm Review
team produces clear recommendations and lessons
learned that will lead to the formulation of a plan of
action to adjust NDP III implementation.
4.2 End-of-Term Evaluation of the
NDP III
The End-of-Term Evaluation of the NDP III should be scheduled
early enough so that its major findings can be taken
into account for the NDP IV formulation process, likely
influencing the approach and methodology of the next
phase of Somaliland’s national development planning. Figure
11 shows a recommended calendar for the End-of-Term
Evaluation.
The calendar for the End-of-Term Evaluation is similar to the
one for the Midterm Review, but with several differences:
• Whereas the Review starts with the joint approval of
the methodology this is not the case for the Evaluation,
as this will already be part of the procurement
process.
• The Evaluation will most likely be done by an external
consultancy through a formal procurement tendering
process. The companies that were selected in the
expression of interest phase will be invited to submit
a technical and financial proposal. An important
part of the technical proposal will be a detailed and
well-founded explanation of the evaluation methodology
they are proposing.
• In contrast with the Midterm Review, the focus of the
End-of-Term Evaluation should be on the achievement
of outcome targets. To facilitate this, MoPND
must ensure that, at minimum, the National Annual
Progress Reports for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027
are made available to the evaluation team.
• Instead of an action plan based on recommendations
for NDP III adjustment, the evaluation process
will culminate in two additional activities, both to be
produced by the consultants (and should therefore
be included in their terms of reference):
• The organisation of one or more seminars to
debate lessons learned, engaging with core
staff of all sectors
• Approval of a document with recommendations
for the NDP IV formulation process
• Financial resources have been tentatively planned
in the NDP III budget for the End-of-Term Evaluation
(US$ 300,000). However, a final budget needs to
be based on contract negotiations at the end of the
tendering process.
Outcome indicators using survey data were avoided as
much as possible, as it would be difficult to guarantee the
availability of data in 2027 for verifying the achievement of
outcome indicator targets.
However, an exception was made for the Somaliland Health
and Demographic Survey for the following three reasons:
• It contains important social indicators on a large cluster
basis that can only be obtained through surveys.
• MoPND’s CSD is heavily involved in the preparation
and implementation of the SLHDS.
• The last SLHDS was performed in 2020 in conjunction
with the NDP III formulation to provide baseline
values for key outcome indicators. MoPND’s CSD
should negotiate financial resources and technical
support so that another survey can be conducted in
2026 in time for the End-of-Term evaluation of the
NDP III, while simultaneously providing baseline values
for the NDP IV.

5. ACCOUNTABILITY
Over the years, M&E has evolved into the MEAL approach,
adding the concepts of accountability and learning. This is
the result of the realization that mere data collection for
M&E will not automatically lead to accountability, institutional
learning, and, most importantly, improvements in evidence-
based decision making. Because the public sector
has a clear chain of command for reporting, these reporting
routines go hand-in-hand with accountability.
A number of reporting routines were previously mentioned
that are meant to improve accountability:
• All reporting includes a section with conclusions and
recommendations to facilitate discussions in subsequent
management meetings.
• All MDAs are strongly advised to prepare 3-6 monthly
Operational Progress Reports and subsequently
organise senior management meetings to discuss
progress on operational benchmarks, using the RBM
matrix as a guiding tool.
• Each year, sector lead MDAs will prepare Sector
Outcome Progress Reports and discuss the results in
the relevant Sector Coordination Forum, which also
includes development partners.
• Data related to NDP III outcome indicator targets will
be validated each year by MoPND’s CSD, which will
also be responsible for their publication in the annual
Somaliland-in-Figures report.
• The compiled NDP III National Annual Progress
Report will be approved by the National Planning
Commission and shared with the highest authorities,
including the Somaliland High-Level Development
Coordination Forum.
The MoPND has a vital role to play in reinforcing these
reporting routines and supporting an institutional culture of
accountability throughout the NDP III process.

6. LEARNING
Learning is a continuous process and can take place in
any circumstance. However, it cannot be taken for granted
that learning will automatically take place, especially at an
institutional level, where it is often a slow process.
Therefore, it is important to structure the learning process
and consciously build in learning moments during NDP III
implementation. The previously mentioned NDP III Midterm
Review and End-of-Term Evaluation are examples of
learning at the highest level, but these moments can be
organised at lower levels (MDA, regional, district, etc.) and
happen more frequently. A key annual learning opportunity
is in May-June before the National Budgeting Exercise
starts, but after the MDA’s Annual Progress Report has been
made, so that conclusions and recommendations can feed
into the next national budgeting cycle. There is a short-term
cost attached to the learning process, but in the medium- to
long-term, if well executed, it will lead to substantial savings
by improving the effectiveness of interventions.
Figure 12 presents potential important learning moments
for institutions at different levels during the NDP III implementation
period: Please note the following:
• Figure 12 shows potential learning moments. Each
institution, based on their perception of the NDPIII
implementation process, must determine how and
when to organise learning activities.
• Learning events need to be well structured. It should
be clear what the potential lessons learned are, who
should be invited to be able to have a well-balanced
and open dialogue, and how to structure the learning
process so that the event will lead to useful results.
Think about the potential added value of one or
more external facilitators, utilizing persons who bring
in relevant expertise, the presentation of relevant
lessons learned elsewhere, etc.
• Learning events that take place before the onset of
the annual national budgeting exercise could potentially
have an impact if lessons learned could include
recommendations for altering budget allocations for
some MDAs.

7. WHO DOES WHAT, AND WHEN?
7.1 Government Officials
Sector technical staff involved in data
collection at the central, regional and
district levels
Technical staff involved in data collection are on the supply
side of the data value chain, they must:
• Familiarize themselves with the RBM matrices relevant
to their sector. For the sector, this means all
outcomes, outcome indicators and targets for 2027.
For the MDA, this means all critical outputs and annual
operational benchmarks for which their institution
is responsible.
• Reflect on their role in data collection and reporting
for each of the NDP III indicators and benchmarks,
based on their institution’s deadlines and instructions.
• Ensure data collection takes place according to
standards, formats, and deadlines set by their institution.
• Verify that data is correct before submission. Whenever
relevant, data should also be accompanied by
contextual comments.
• Submit data to their superiors in the data chain
according to set deadlines.
Ministers, DGs and heads of PSDs/M&E
units
Ministers, directors general, and heads of the PSDs/M&E
units are on the demand side of the data value chain. In
other words, they need management information to improve
the performance of their institution, and this information
can only be made available if relevant and reliable data
has been collected. The heads of PSDs/M&E units should:
• Familiarize themselves with the RBM matrices relevant
to their sector. For the sector, this means all
outcomes, outcome indicators and targets for 2027.
For the MDA, this means all critical outputs and annual
operational benchmarks for which their institution
is responsible.
• Guarantee oversight of data collection and Progress
Report preparation by ensuring the following:
• There are clear instructions for data collection,
including uniform formats, for government staff
and managers of sector-aligned projects.
• Operational benchmark reporting and discussion
occurs every 3-6 months so that adjustments
can be made during year. These reports
should be internally validated no more than 6
weeks after the end of the reporting period.
An end-of year summary report on progress
during the year needs to be compiled and validated
at the MDA level by the end of February
of the following year at the latest, which is then
incorporated into the Annual Progress Report.
• Outcome indicator targets are collected during
January and February of the following year.
• Once data is collected and analysed for all
relevant Sector Outcome indicators, as well as
the Critical outputs and associated Operational
benchmarks, and conclusions and recommendations
have been duly formulated, the Annual
Progress Report is drafted and submitted
to senior management (DG, minister/agency
director) every year by April 15 at the latest.
• Organise a special management meeting for the
discussion and validation of the Annual Progress
Report (data, conclusions, and recommendations) by
the end of April at the latest.
• Communicate all relevant end-of-year outcome
indicators to MoPND’s CSD every year by May 15 at
the latest. The CSD is responsible for quality control
and publication.
• Submit the MDA’s validated Annual Progress Report
every year to MoPND’s M&E department by May 15
at the latest. Every year, the M&E department will
compile all MDA Reports into a single NDP III Annual
Progress Report for publication by the end of July.
• Disseminate the MDA’s Annual Progress Report to
all members of the relevant Sector Coordination
Forum. The report’s conclusions and recommendations
of the Annual Progress Reports of relevant
MDAs should be shared and discussed in a SCF
meeting.
Key Staff of the Ministry of Planning and
National Development
The MoPND is involved in the following activities for the
NDP III MEAL process:
• Ensuring that all government institutions and associated
projects respect standards and deadlines as
described in this document.
• Compiling, validating, and disseminating the MDA
Annual Progress Reports into a NDP III National Annual
Progress Report.
• Verifying NDP III outcome indicator values and
publishing this data in a special section of Somaliland-
in-Figures.
7.2 Non-GoSL Project Management
Staff
Managers of sector-aligned projects and programmes
with a role in data collection are recommended to do the
following:
• Familiarize themselves with the RBM matrices relevant
to their sector. For the sector, this means all
outcomes, outcome indicators and targets for 2027.
For the MDA, this means all critical outputs and annual
operational benchmarks for which their institution
is responsible.
• Reflect on their role in data collection and reporting
for each of the NDP III indicators and benchmarks,
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 172
based on guidelines and deadlines for the MDA(s)
they are supporting.
• Inquire about sector standards, formats, and
deadlines in relation to the collection of data. If any
problems are apparent, these should be flagged and
discussed with the relevant PSD director.
• Ensure data collection takes place according to
standards, formats, and deadlines set by the relevant
MDA.
• Verify that data is correct before submission. Whenever
relevant, data should also be accompanied by
contextual comments.
• Submit data to the relevant PSD(s) according to set
deadlines.
• Participate in the SCF meeting where sector progress,
conclusions, and recommendations will be
discussed. This meeting should take place every
year before June 1.
7.3 MEAL Implementation Calendar
Please note the following details:
• The monitoring of progress towards critical outputs
and their associated benchmarks occurs every 3-6
months, whereas the monitoring of progress towards
outcome targets occurs once a year. These are essentially
separate process that come together in the
Annual Progress Reports.
• Inside MoPND, the CSD is responsible for the validation
of NDP III outcome indicator-related data and its
annual publication.
• At the same time, MoPND’s M&E department is
responsible for the compilation of the MDA Annual
Progress Reports into an annual NDP III National
Progress Report, including its dissemination after
validation by the minister of planning.
• Critical outputs and their associated operational
benchmarks, as well are their subsequent reporting,
are always assigned to specific MDAs. In contrast,
outcomes and outcome targets are assigned to specific
sectors. This means that it is not always clear in
sectors with more than one MDA who is responsible
for outcome data collection and reporting. Therefore,
MoPND assigns each sector a lead MDA who will be
responsible to report to the CSD on outcome values
and supporting data.

ANNEX 1: SECTOR RBM MATRICES
The sector Results-based Management (RBM) matrices
consist of two sections:
1. The top-section describes the expected outcome,
accompanied by an outcome indicator, a baseline
value, and a target for the end of the year 2027. This
is identical to the RBM approach used for the NDP II.
2. The bottom section breaks down the process to reach
the outcome target by identifying the most critical
outputs and their annual operational benchmarks.
This section also notes the lead MDA responsible for
implementation and reporting. This consists of:
• Approximately 2-4 critical outputs for each MDA
contributing to the outcome.
• A set of operational annual benchmarks for
each critical output, which allows for monitoring
progress during the year(s). There are two types
of operational benchmarks:
• Quantitative benchmarks subdivide an
entire numerical five year target for the
NDP III into annual targets in the years they
are expected to take place. Note that numeric
targets can be either annual targets,
showing expected achievements only for
that year, or accumulative targets, showing
the total target for that year, including all
previous years.
• Qualitative benchmarks indicate milestones,
or advances expected to be made
in a qualitative process in the years they are
expected to take place.
The bottom section of the RBM matrix has been added for
the following reasons:
• It structures the process to achieve the outcome
in several concrete steps, allowing a better understanding
of what is needed to reach the outcome
target from year to year. This may better facilitate a
common understanding of the process, assist MDA
staff when making their annual plan and budget, and
guide dialogue with development partners and other
stakeholders.
• It is meant to be an internal tool for monitoring,
reflection, and analysis for MDA managers who are
responsible for achieving the annual benchmarks. It
is advised to discuss the status of progress and identify
bottlenecks and operational adjustments every
3-6 months.
• This section of RBM matrix is also meant to be used
to structure annual reporting to the MoPND, who is
responsible for compiling, at least once a year, all
sector reports into a single NDP III Progress Report.
It is expected that the tool will facilitate and improve
the quality of regular NDP III reporting.

ANNEX 2: GLOSSARY
There are many different definitions of concepts used in monitoring and evaluation. This glossary refers mostly to the
“Glossary of Key Terms in Evaluation and Results Based Management”, from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (2010).
Term Definition
Data aggregation The process where raw data is gathered and expressed in a summary form for statistical
analysis. There are two types of data aggregation:
• Time aggregation: Sums all data points for a single resource over a specified period.
• Spatial aggregation: Sums all data points for a group of resources over a specified period.
Data collation The collection or construction of ordered systems of data from raw data. This organises data in
a specified order and system (such as in tables).
Data compilation The collation of raw data and its transformation into a format that can be easily manipulated
or combined with other data in preparation for further analysis. In the context of this MEAL
supplement, it also refers to bringing together organised data sets from different sectors into a
single report.
Data registration The initial collection of data, best done when the event that needs to be registered occurs. For
example, this could be done in a village when a child is vaccinated by registering the inoculation
using a special form.
Data validation The process of determining whether a particular piece of information falls within an acceptable
and credible range of values.
Data verification Checking data to ensure that it is accurate, consistent, and reflects its intended purpose.
Evaluation The systematic and objective assessment of an on-going or completed project, programme, or
policy, including its design, implementation, and results. The aim is to determine the relevance
and fulfilment of objectives, development efficiency, effectiveness, impact, and sustainability.
An evaluation should provide information that is credible and useful, enabling the incorporation
of lessons learned into the decision making process of both recipients and donors.
HLDCF High-Level Development Coordination Forum, a formal consultation forum between the
Somaliland government and development partners.
Impact The primary and secondary long-term effects produced by a development intervention, directly
or indirectly. Impacts can be positive or negative and be intended or unintended. In the context
of the NDP III, impact indicator targets formulate and quantify or qualify desired long-term
effects, which are the result of multi-sectoral contributions and can therefore not be attributed
to a single sector.
Institutional memory The information held by a group of employees’ personal recollections and experiences of
working related occurrences, systems, and processes.
Indicator A quantitative or qualitative factor or variable that provides a simple and reliable means to
measure achievement, reflecting changes connected to an intervention or helping to assess
the performance of a development actor.
Intervention A group or series of activities that are designed to contribute in a coherent way to the same
output or outcome.
Critical intervention An intervention that is essential if an output or outcome is to be achieved.
Lead intervention A primary intervention that, if to be successful, needs to be accompanied by one or more
complementary or secondary interventions. For example, building a health clinic (the primary
intervention) needs to be accompanied by the recruitment of staff, purchase of medicine, etc.
(the secondary interventions).
Complementary
intervention
An intervention that is necessary to guarantee the success of a lead intervention. If a lead
intervention is cancelled, then the complementary interventions should also be cancelled.
Milestone A moment in time (day, week, month, year) when a piece of work must be finished or an
objective must be achieved.
Republic of Somaliland National Development Plan III 227
Monitoring A continuing function that uses the systematic collection of data on specified indicators to
provide the management and key stakeholders of an ongoing development intervention with
indications of the extent of progress and achievement of objectives.
Outcome The likely or achieved short- and medium-term effects of an intervention’s outputs. An outcome
describes the expected change in reality.
Descriptive Sector
Outcome
In the context of the NDP III, this outcome describes an important real change in the sector,
although it cannot be attributed to direct interventions by the GoSL.
A typical example would be levels of dryland crop production, as this is largely determined
by rainfall patterns and direct support to farmers does not have sufficient magnitude to justify
measurable changes in agricultural production at the national level. However, this is still
included as an outcome for measurement to enhance the understanding of the real situation in
the sector.
Outputs The products, capital, goods, and services which result from a development intervention. This
may also include changes resulting from the intervention which are relevant to the achievement
of outcomes.
Critical outputs Outputs that are the result of a critical intervention.
Indicator targets,
accumulative
If an indicator target is accumulative, then the value shown for a certain year represents the
actual situation up to the end of that year, including all previous years.
Indicator targets,
annual
If an indicator target is annual, then the value shown for a certain year represents the expected
achievements for that year only, excluding all achievements from the previous years.
Statistical outlier An observation that is well outside of the expected range of values. It should therefore be
double-checked for accuracy, or, if deemed unreliable, should be discarded from the data set.
