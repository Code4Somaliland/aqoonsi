					<h3>What</h3>
					<p>On 26 June 1960, 35 countries including the 5 permanent members of the security council recognised Somaliland as an independent state.</p>
					<p> After 5 days, Somaliland made an unfinished illegal union which was later fixed in 1991 by declaring independence again.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>How</h3>
					<p>
						Similar to how Somaliland got recognition from 35 countries in 5 days, <strong> 5 days </strong> and with your help, we aim to have  
						<strong> 35 new world leaders and celebrities</strong> to support Somaliland's independence.
						
					</p>
					<p>We want everyone to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aqoonsi.com/why">join existing world leaders</a> 
						who support Somaliland's independence. We must hurry, we only have 5 days and surely we do not want to have an immature and repressive union again!</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="column">
					<h3>Why</h3>
					<p>
						We want the world to remmeber to re-recognise Somaliland's indepdence after 30 years of decomacy, peace and successful state building.
